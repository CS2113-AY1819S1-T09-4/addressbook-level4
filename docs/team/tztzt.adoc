== Project: 'Savee' - A Desktop Financial Planner

== Overview

=== Project Information

'Savee' is a desktop financial planner application my team created for our Software Engineering Principles module in
Semester 1 of our 2nd year.

I worked in a group of 4 members for the project and were each expected to make contributions to the project by adding
both minor enhancements and major features to the software. Each group was initially provided with a base code written in
Java with about 10 kLoC and was a simple Address Book desktop product. Our task was to morph the existing code into any
other software we opted to.

The module evaluated us based on our ability to work with existing base code and the quality of our new modifications to
the existing code. Besides code, I also helped write User Guide and Developer Guide as well for the product
as though my team were releasing an official product to simulate an actual project work schedule.

=== Product Information

Users of Savee interact with its simple command-line interface (CLI), as well as its graphical user interface created
using JavaFX. It is targeted at users who enjoy typing and are keen on managing their finances wellbeing responsibly
using a desktop interface.

The application revolves around usage of the CLI to manage one's finances. Users can store a `Record` consisting of
`name`, `moneyflow`, `date` and `tags` of any form of financial activity in the application. `Moneyflow` would be the expenditure
or income of the financial activity, `date` would be the actual date the activity was performed on and `tags` is a
system for users to categorise their data.

Above is a screenshot of my team's product on startup, as well as the key enhancement I made described in the next section.

== Summary of Contributions

=== *Major Enhancement #1*: ability to autocomplete text input

** *Function*: display a popup-box of suggested words to autocomplete with when user inputs parts of a word.
** *Significance*: +

This enhancement improves the product significantly because users who may not be familiar with the software commands can
save time using the software by keying in parts of a command word they want to use and simply complete the
command using the list of suggested words. It also helps users to fill in command parameters which may be
frequently used or likely to repeated.

** *Key Highlights*:

This enhancement was simple to implement but challenging to perfect in order to achieve the
intended convenience it provides to users.

I needed to accurately read the user input and provide a different range of suggestions depending on the
command word input by the user as well as any other parameters that may be required by the command.
While it may seem a simple feature, I wrote an extensive amount of code for this feature to ensure the auto complete
performed its role successfully, which was to make the experience of typing on Savee more enjoyable. I implemented this
enhancement for most of the commands in the software and as such, was no easy feat as every command
                                                                                                   had its own unique format and function.

** *Credits*: The Java TextFields (AutoComplete) Library and its inner classes were recreated and tweaked
to achieve the necessary aims of our product autocomplete functionality.

=== *Minor Enhancement #1*: ability to find data by tags

** *Function*: allows users to find and display all data with a specific attribute `tag`.
** *Significance*: +

As mentioned in <<Product Information>>, each piece of data can be categorised with up to 2 tags which is limited to
1 word alphanumerics. This feature improves the product by providing another means of filtering data that they may
wish to hide and show according to their needs.

** *Key Highlights*: +

This enhancement, while simple to implement, is still a key enhancement to complement the many other data filtering
functions offered by Savee.

=== *Minor Enhancement #2*: ability to sort data

** *Function*: allows users to sort their data by a specific category and in a specific order
** *Significance*: +

This feature improves the product by providing users with another means of manipulating
and reorganising their data to display in their desired manner. While there were other methods to organise data as
well, there was no implementation yet to alter the order the records were displayed in.

** *Key Highlights*: +

This enhancement was slightly more challenging to implement than expected as it required use of
multiple comparators as well as a suitable data structure that supported sorting. The base code utilised
a *FilteredList* structure in order to set up the filters for the data search functions and hence did not
support Sorting. Hence, while not an ideal implementation, sorting was performed on the underlying
data structure which was a simple array list.

* *Code contributed*:

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Pull requests made had to be approved by one other team member and I helped to evaluate pull
requests to ensure only necessary changes to the code was merged.

** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Added and improved utility methods for comparison and sorting that were easily reusable.
(Pull requests https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-T09-4/main/pull/64/files[#64])

** Documentation:
*** Made significant changes to reorganise User Guide user readability.
