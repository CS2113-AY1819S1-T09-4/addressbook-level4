== PROJECT: FinancialPlanner

== Overview

FinancialPlanner is a desktop financial planner application used for teaching Software Engineering
principles. The user interacts with it using a command-line interface (CLI), and it has a graphical
user interface created using JavaFX.

We worked in groups of 4 - 5 members for the project and were each expected to make contributions to the project by a
dding both minor enhancements and major features to the software. We were initially provided with the base code which
is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC. Our task was to morph the existing code into any other software we opted to.

We would be evaluated based on our ability to work with existing base code and the quality of our new enhancements to
the existing code. Besides code, we were expected to write a User Guide and Developer Guide as well for the product
as though we were releasing an official product for public usage to simulate an actual work schedule.

We choose to create our application FinancialPlanner to allow users keep track of their financial status using a
desktop application and is targeted at users who enjoy typing and are keen on managing their finances responsibly.

The application revolves around usage of the CLI to manage one's finances. Users can store `name`, `moneyflow`, `date`
and `tags` of any form of financial activity in the application as a `Record`. `Moneyflow` would be the expenditure
or income of the financial activity, `date` would be the actual date the activity was performed on and `tags` is a
system for users to label their data for easy access. 

== Summary of Contributions

=== `ongoing` *Major Enhancement #1*: added the ability to autocomplete text input

** What it does: displays a popup-box of suggested words to autocomplete with when user inputs parts of a word.
** Justification: this feature improves the product significantly because users who may not be familiar with
the software commands can save time using the software by keying in parts of a command word they want to use
and simply complete the command using the list of suggested words. It also helps users to fill in some command
parameters which may be commonly used or likely to repeated.
** Highlights: This enhancement was simple to implement but challenging to perfect in order to maximise the
convenience it provides to users.
We needed to accurately read the user input and provide a different range of suggestions depending on the
command word input by the user as well as any other parameters that may be required by the command.
** Credits: The Java TextFields (AutoComplete) Library and its inner classes were recreated and tweaked
to achieve the necessary aims of our product autocomplete functionality.

=== `completed` *Minor Enhancement #1*: added the ability to find data by tags

** What it does: allows users to find and display all data with a specific attribute `tag`.
** Justification: this feature improves the product by providing another means of filtering data that
they may wish to hide and show according to their needs.
** Highlights: this enhancement was simple to implement but was a key enhancement that led to better use of
every attribute of our data

=== `completed` *Minor Enhancement #2*: added the ability to sort data

** What it does: allows users to sort their data by a specific category and in a specific order
** Justification: this feature improves the product by providing users with another means of manipulating
and reorganising their data to display in their desired manner.
** Highlights: This enhancement was more challenging to implement than expected as it required use of
multiple comparators as well as a suitable data structure that supported sorting. It sparked evaluation
of the different ways to implement sorting as some structures used were not suitable or inefficient.
