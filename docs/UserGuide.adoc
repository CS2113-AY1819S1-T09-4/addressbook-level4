== Introduction

FinancialPlanner (FP) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their finances*. More
importantly, FP is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FP can get your finance management
tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

[[Features]]
== Basic Features

This section describes the basic features essential to using our Financial Planner.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter
which can be used as `add n/Grocery shopping`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Grocery shopping t/friend` or as
`n/Grocery shopping`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}`
(i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME m/MONEYFLOW`, `m/MONEYFLOW n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

====
*Parameter Constraints* [[constraints]]

* By Month: `summary month d/START_MONTH END_MONTH`
* By Category: `summary category d/START_DATE END_DATE`

****
* Note that there are specific formats required for the dates and months entered.
* For the commands *"summary date"* and *"summary category"*, START_DATE/END_DATE must be in the format of
`dd-mm-yyyy` where `dd` represents day, `mm` represents month, `yyyy` represents year. All parameters should be specified in numerical form.
* For command *"summary month"*, START_MONTH/END_MONTH must in the format of `mmm-yyyy`, `mmm` represents the month with its three letter representations, and
`yyyy` represents the year in its numerical form.
* Note that for mmm, it is case-insensitive, meaning both *"APR"* and *"apr"* are accepted
****

Examples:

* `summary date d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018`
* `summary month d/apr-2018 sep-2018`

* `summary category d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018`

The screenshots below are examples of what you can see once the command has been accepted.

image::UiSummaryByDateTable.png[width="790"]
*Screenshot of app when `summary date d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018` is run*

image::UiSummaryByMonthTable.png[width="790"]
*Screenshot of app when `summary month d/jan-2018 dec-2018` is run*

image::UiSummaryByCategoryTable.png[width="790"]
*Screenshot of app when `summary category d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018` is run*

// end::summary[]
// tag::stats[]
=== Showing a breakdown of total expenses and income into categories: `stats`

Shows a breakdown of total expenses and income into categories and displays these information in a pie chart. +
Format:`stats d/START_DATE END_DATE`

****
* START_DATE/END_DATE follow the same configurations as date parameters required when adding records. It is in the form of
*dd-mm-yyyy* where *dd* represents day, *mm* represents month and *yyyy* represents the year. *dd* and *mm* both require 1 to 2 digits while
*yyyy* requires exactly 4 digits.
****

Once the command has been executed, 2 tabs will appear showing a pie chart containing data that is relevant in the range. +

[NOTE]
Due to label constraints, some labels may not be displaying correctly if they are overlapping with other labels. This happens when the pie slice
is too small. To improve readability, we have decided to hide some labels in such scenarios. Also, when the label is too long, since the pie charts
need to fit the labels, the pie chart may become small as a result. To prevent such situations, please keep your labels short. This will be improved in
later versions of the product to remove the labels completely and use a mouse over input instead.

Examples:

* `stats d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018`

Below are some screenshots of what you can see when the command has been accepted.

image::UiPieChartExpense.png[width="790"]
*Screenshot of app displaying expense breakdown when `stats d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018` is run*

image::UiPieChartIncome.png[width="790"]
*Screenshot of app displaying income breakdown when `stats d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018` is run*

// end::stats[]
// end::welcomepanel[]
=== Showing a breakdown of total expenses and income into categories of this month: `NO COMMAND REQUIRED`

Shows a breakdown of total expenses and income into categories using data of this month. +
No format is required for this feature as the feature is automatically triggered when there is any changes to the list of records within the application.

This feature automatically tracks the current date and ensures that the data presented is updated regardless regardless of whether the application is off or on for
prolonged periods of time. +

Even in the event where the user is using the application at close to 12 midnight of the last day of a particular month and the clocks strikes 12,
the application will update the data whenever it detects any record data modifications in the app to reflect the next month.

[NOTE]
The data used to represent the pie charts in the welcome panel is *only updated* whenever there are any changes to records within the FinancialPlanner. +
This includes adding records, deleting records and editing records in the FinancialPlanner.

Below shows a snapshot of what the user can see when there are records available of the current month

image::WelcomePanelWithPieCharts.png[width="790"]
*Screenshot of app on startup when records of current month are available*

* *Dual argument Date mode + Single argument Directory path mode* will list down all records with the date that fall on either dates or between both dates and exports all shown records to an Excel file and store the file in the chosen Directory Path.
+
****

****
* Date follow the same configurations as date parameters required when adding records. It is in the form of *dd-mm-yyyy* where *dd* represents day, *mm* represents month and *yyyy* represents the year. *dd* and *mm* both require 1 to 2 digits while
*yyyy* requires exactly 4 digits.
****

Examples:

* `export_excel`
* `export_excel d/31-3-1999`
* `export_excel d/31-3-1999 31-03-2019`
* `export_excel d/31-3-1999 dir/C:\`
* `export_excel d/31-3-1999 31-3-2019 dir/C:\`

The Excel file name will be named based on the command, relating to Date: +

* *Default mode*: The Excel file will be named `Financial_Planner_ALL.xlsx`
* *Single argument Date mode*: The Excel file will be named `Financial_Planner_dd-mm-yyyy.xlsx`
* *Dual argument Date*: The Excel file will be named `Financial_Planner_dd-mm-yyyy_dd-mm-yyyy.xlsx`
+

There will be two sheets in the Excel file, namely `RECORD DATA` and `SUMMARY DATA`.

* `RECORD DATA` stores all the data of record the user want to export, there are 4 columns: Name, date, money and tags, the tags names will be separated by ..., for visual benefit.

image::Export_Capture1_LinhChi.png[width:800]

* `SUMMARY DATA` stored the summary statistics for the period you exported, and there is a *Line Chart* next to the table for visual statistic [refer to `Draw line chart` part for more information].
** As you can see in the picture, there are 3 series shown:
*** The first blue line named Income represents the relation between Timeline (each component is one Date) and the Income (each component is one income).
*** The second orange line named Outcome represents the relation between Timeline (each component is one Date) and the Outcome (each component is one outcome).
*** The third grey line named Net represents the relation Timeline (each component is one Date) and the Net - Sum of income and outcome (each component is one net).

image::Export_Capture2_LinhChi.png[width:800]

As the size of the Chart is fixed initially. Sometimes, when user exports too many dates, the distance between each date on the chart might be tight. It is suggesting that the user justify the size of the chart by himself/herself.


// end::export_excel[]

// tag::import[]

=== Import the records stored from the Excel file. `import`

There are 2 modes, single argument File Path mode and (single argument Directory Path + single argument File Name) mode +

* `SUMMARY DATA` stored the summary statistics for the period you archived, and there is a *Line Chart* next to the table for visual statistic [refer to `Draw line chart` part for more information].
** As you can see in the picture, there are 3 series shown:
*** The first blue line named Income represents the relation between Timeline (each component is one Date) and the Income (each component is one income).
*** The second orange line named Outcome represents the relation between Timeline (each component is one Date) and the Outcome (each component is one outcome).
*** The third grey line named Net represents the relation Timeline (each component is one Date) and the Net - Sum of income and outcome (each component is one net).

As the size of the Chart is fixed initially. Sometimes, when user archive too many dates, the distance between each date on the chart might be tight. It is suggesting that the user justify the size of the chart by himself/herself.

== Spending Limit Features

* This section describes the limit feature that allows users to set values to control their future spending.
Constraints that apply to records also apply to each limit. Refer to <<constraints>> for more information.


[[addlimit]]
=== Adding a limit: `addlimit`

Adds a spending limit for a time period or a particular day to the FinancialPlanner. +
Format: `addlimit d/START_DATE END_DATE m/MONEYFLOW` (`limit d/DATE m/MONEYFLOW`)+

When inputting two days, START_DATE and END_DATE indicates the starting date and ending date for the limit.
If there is only one date, that day will be the time period.
MONEYFLOW denotes the money spending limit for that period of time.

* After the limits have been added, Financial Planner will keep checking the latest condition of these limits.
Once the total amount of money spent during this time period exceeds the spending limit,
FinancialPlanner will warn the user by sending the warning message.
****
* DATE_START must be earlier or equal than DATE_END. When DATE_START and DATE_END are the same, this will be equivalent to single DATE.
* Moneyflow for limit features can only be a positive integer, and does not require a "+" or "-".
* Any date or period of time can only have at most 1 assigned limit.
****

Example:

* `addlimit d/20-8-2018 m/100`
* `addlimit d/20-8-2018 30-8-2018 m/632`
* `addlimit d/20-8-2018 30-8-2018 m/100`

[[checklimit]]
=== Viewing all limits: `checkLimit`

Displays all limits information stored in FinancialPlanner +
Format: `checklimit`
Example:
* `checklimit`


[[deletelimit]]
=== Deleting a limit: `deleteLimit`

Deletes an existing spending limit from the FinancialPlanner +
Format: `deleteLimit d/START_DATE END_DATE` (`deleteLimit d/START_DATE`) +

The deleting command is based on the date period, since there will be at most one limit
for one period of time, user only need to enter a period of time or a single date. The limit
with the same dates will be deleted. If there is no limit for that period, the program will
throw errors.
Delete
****
* There must be a limit with the same dates.
* Limits cannot be partially deleted with incorrect dates.
****

Examples:

* `deletelimit d/20-8-2018`
* `deletelimit d/20-8-2018 30-8-2018`


[[editlimit]]
=== Editing a limit: `editLimit`

Edit a limit to the FinancialPlanner +
Format: `editLimit d/START_DATE END_DATE m/MONEYFLOW` (`editLimit d/START_DATE END_DATE m/MONEYFLOW`)+

Editlimit is similar to <<deletelimit>> command, it is also based on the date period.
The editlimit command will check the input date period or the single day and
replace the original moneyFlow with the new moneyFlow.
****
* `MONEYFLOW` can only be a positive integer, and does not require a "+" or "-".
* There must be a limit with the same dates.
****

Examples:

* `editlimit d/20-8-2018 m/200`
* `editlimit d/20-8-2018 30-8-2018 m/200`


=== Adding a monthly limit: `addmonthlylimit`

Add a continuous monthly limit always for the current month.
Format: `addmonthlylimit m/MONEYFLOW`

The monthly limit will always check the spend of the current month according to the current time.
For example, if the limit was set to be 200 at April, the limit will check the total spend for April.
When the time comes to May, the limit will no longer check April, instead, the limit
will check the total spend of May until the last second of May.

****
* `MONEYFLOW` can only be a positive integer, and does not require a "+" or "-".
****
Examples:
* `addmonthlylimit m/200`

=== Editing the monthly limit: `editmonthlylimit`

Edit an existing monthly limit.
Format: `editmonthlylimit m/MONEYFLOW`

The monthly limit will be replaced by the new monthly limit.
****
* `MONEYFLOW` can only be a positive integer, and does not require a "+" or "-".
* There must be an existing monthly limit.
****
Examples:
* `editmonthlylimit m/200`

=== Deleting the monthly limit: `deletemonthlylimit`

Delete the monthly limit.
Format: `deletemonthlylimit`

The monthly limit will be deleted and no longer check the spend of the current month.
****
* There must be an existing monthly limit.
****
Examples:
* `deletemonthlylimit`
