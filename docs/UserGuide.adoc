== Introduction

FinancialPlanner (FP) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their finances*. More
importantly, FP is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FP can get your finance management
tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

Before a user is able to use our software, he/she is required to do the following simple steps to set up other software
that is required.

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Financial Planner.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all records
* **`add`**`n/Grocery shoppings m/-70 d/20-9-2018 t/Shopping` : adds a contact named `Grocery shopping` to the Financial Planner.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd record shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Basic Features

This section describes the basic features essential to using our Financial Planner.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter
which can be used as `add n/Grocery shopping`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Grocery shopping t/friend` or as
`n/Grocery shopping`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}`
(i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME m/MONEYFLOW`, `m/MONEYFLOW n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

====
*Parameter Constraints* [[constraints]]

* `NAME` can be any word, phrase or sentence.
* `MONEYFLOW` must be made up of only digits, a single "+" or "-" and at most one decimal point.
* `DATE` is in the form of *dd-mm-yyyy* where *dd* represents day, *mm* represents month and *yyyy* represents the year.
*dd* and *mm* both require 1 to 2 digits while *yyyy* requires exactly 4 digits.

A list of possible words will be displayed in a popup-box under the command box according to the user input.

====
* Word suggestions are not case sensitive. e.g. `HEL` will have a possible suggestion `HELP`
* Possible words that contain the user input can also be suggested. e.g. `tag` will have a possbile suggestion `findtag`

====

image::AutoComplete.png[width="790"]

=== Auto Complete for Commands

Command words that contain the word input by the user will appear as possible suggestions.
Refer to <<Features>> and <<morefeatures>> for all possible commands.

====
* Command words are always the first word in the input and are only suggested for the first word input.
====

=== Auto Complete for Tags

When the command word `findtag` has been entered, suggestions will display based on
tags that currently exist in the FinancialPlanner data as tags of other existing records.

Refer to <<findtag>> for
more information on how the `findtag` works.


====
* Any number of tags can be input and every word typed after the command word can bring up the suggestion popup for tags.
====

=== Auto Complete for Sort

When the command word `sort` is entered, suggestion will display based on the possible keyword inputs for the sort function.

Refer to <<sort>> for the sort function keywords.
====
* When a `CATEGORY` has already been entered, the only possible suggestions are `asc` and `desc` as they are the only
`SORT_ORDER possible.
* Likewise, when a `SORT_ORDER` has already been entered, only `CATEGORY` such as `name`, `date` or `money` will be suggested.
* After two words have been keyed in, no other suggestions will be made as `sort` only takes 2 parameters.

== Data Analysis Features

This section describe features for the user to analyse his/her financial status in greater detail.

=== Showing a summary table of all financial activity in a time period: `summary`

Shows a summary table listing each day or month within a given time specified by the user. +
A `summary` is an item that contains information on the *date or month that is represented*, the *total expense calculated*, the *total income calculated* and
the *net money flow calculated.* +

The summary command supports both listing by date and by month. +
Format: +

* By Date: `summary date d/START_DATE END_DATE`
* By Month: `summary month d/START_MONTH END_MONTh`

****
* Note that there are specific formats required for the dates and months entered.
* For *summary by date*, START_DATE/END_DATE must be in the format of
`dd-mm-yyyy` where `dd` represents day, `mm` represents month, `yyyy` represents year. All parameters should be specified in numerical form.
* For *summary by month*, START_MONTH/END_MONTH must in the format of `mmm-yyyy`, `mmm` represents the month with its three letter representations, and
`yyyy` represents the year in its numerical form.
* Note that for mmm, it is case-insensitive, meaning both *"APR"* and *"apr"* are accepted
****

Examples:

* `summary date d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018`
* `summary month d/apr-2018 sep-2018`
* `summary month d/APR-2018 SeP-2018`

The screenshots below are examples of what you can see once the command has been accepted.

Screenshot of app when `summary date d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018` is run

image::UiSummaryByMonthTable.png[width="790"]

=== Showing a breakdown of total expenses and income into categories: `stats`

Shows a breakdown of total expenses and income into categories and displays these information in a pie chart. +
Format:`stats d/START_DATE END_DATE`

****
* START_DATE/END_DATE follow the same configurations as date parameters required when adding records. It is in the form of
*dd-mm-yyyy* where *dd* represents day, *mm* represents month and *yyyy* represents the year. *dd* and *mm* both require 1 to 2 digits while
*yyyy* requires exactly 4 digits.
****

Once the command has been executed, 2 tabs will appear showing a pie chart containing data that is relevant in the range. +
Note that due to label constraints, some labels may not be displaying correctly if they are overlapping with other labels. This happens when the pie slice
is too small. To improve readability, we have decided to hide some labels in such scenarios.

Examples:

* `stats d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018`

Below are some screenshots of what you can see when the command has been accepted.

image::UiPieChartExpense.png[width="790"]

* Dual argument mode: `export_excel d/START_DATE END_DATE`

****
* Default mode will list down all records in the Financial Planner and exports all of them to an Excel file.
* Single argument mode will list down all records with the specified date and exports all shown records to an
Excel file.
* Dual argument mode will list down all records with the date that fall on either dates or between both dates and
exports all shown records to an Excel file. +
****

Examples:

* `export_excel`
* `export_excel d/31-3-1999`
* `export_excel d/31-3-1999 31-03-2019`

== Spending Limit Feature

This section describes the limit feature that allows users to set values to control their future spending.
Constraints that apply to records also apply to each limit. Refer to <<constraints>> for more information.
All the limit related commands are case insensitive. Users can input ADDlimit, addLimit and so on.

=== Adding a limit: `addlimit`

Adds a spending limit for a time period or a particular day to the FinancialPlanner. +
Format: `addlimit d/START_DATE END_DATE m/MONEYFLOW` (`limit d/DATE m/MONEYFLOW`)+

START_DATE and END_DATE indicates the starting date and ending date for the limit.
If there is only one date, that day will be the time period
MONEYFLOW denotes the money limit for that period of time.
once the total amount of money spent during this time period exceeds the spending limit,
FinancialPlanner will warn the user by sending the warning message.
****
* Moneyflow can only be a positive integer, and does not require a "+" or "-".
* Any date or period of time can only have at most 1 assigned limit.
