== Introduction

Savee is a financial planner application for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their finances*. More
importantly, FP is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). To enjoy the *full* benefits of the GUI of this app,
the best screen resolution to use would be `1920 x 1080 (1080p)` with the app in fullscreen. Other screen resolutions are also
supported, but the GUI display would be slightly different from the ones shown in the picture.
If you can type fast, FP can get your finance management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Quick Start

Before a user is able to use our software, he/she is required to do the following simple steps to set up other software
that is required.

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `Savee.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your copy of Savee.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all records
* **`add`**`n/Grocery shopping m/-70 d/20-9-2018 t/Shopping` : adds a contact named `Grocery shopping` to Savee.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd record shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Basic Features

This section describes the basic features essential to using Savee.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter
which can be used as `add n/Grocery shopping`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Grocery shopping t/friend` or as
`n/Grocery shopping`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}`
(i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME m/MONEYFLOW`, `m/MONEYFLOW n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

====
[[constraints]]
*Parameter Constraints*

* `NAME` can be any word, phrase or sentence.
* `MONEYFLOW` must be made up of only digits, a single "+" or "-" and at most one decimal point. Also, note that the maximum number of
digits the whole number part of this parameter can have is 12 digits.
* `DATE` is in the form of *dd-mm-yyyy* where *dd* represents day, *mm* represents month and *yyyy* represents the year.
*dd* and *mm* both require 1 to 2 digits while *yyyy* requires exactly 4 digits.
* `DATE` entered must also be a valid date, no fake dates e.g. *60-11-2018*, *30-02-2018*. Leap years are also accounted for, meaning that you
can enter *29-2-2016* and it will still be accepted.
* `TAG` is completely optional and can be any alphanumerical word, but limited to only 1 whole word, no whitespaces are allowed. Also,
the maximum character length of the tag is 20 characters long. The maximum allowed tags is 2 as these tags will be used to categorise each
record, to reduce effort on user's part in specifying another field.
* `INDEX` *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`

====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Displays a help page with information on all commands in Savee.

Format: `help`

=== Adding a record: `add`

Adds a record of a financial activity to Savee with the given name, date, money earned or spent and tags. +
Format: `add n/NAME d/DATE m/MONEYFLOW [t/TAG]...` +

Name denotes the name of the financial activity, moneyflow denotes the money spent or gained in the financial activity
and date denotes the date the financial activity was completed. Each financial activity can be labelled with maximum of 2
of tags as these tags will be used to categorise each record to remove the need for user to specify another field.

[NOTE]
Moneyflow can be either a debit (expense) or a credit (income). +
To distinguish between an expense and an income, the user will need to enter a plus "+" or minus "-" sign before the
money amount. +
Only 1 record of the same name, same date and same moneyflow is allowed in the application. Duplicates of the same record is not
allowed unless it is of a different date, of a different moneyflow or of a different name.

Examples:

* `add n/Payment To John d/20-8-2018 m/-10`

Format: `exit`

=== Saving the data

All data in Savee is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually. In the event that the storage data cannot be read successfully due to parsing error,
the system would initiate Savee with a blank state.

== Auto Complete Feature

This section describes the auto completing feature implemented in the command box.
A list of possible words will be displayed in a popup-box under the command box according to the user input.

====
* Word suggestions are not case sensitive. e.g. `HEL` will have a possible suggestion `HELP`
* Possible words that contain the user input can also be suggested. e.g. `tag` will have a possbile suggestion `findtag`
* Whitespaces are ignored in the input regardless of where they appear.
* Auto completion is performed word by word.
====

image::AutoComplete.png[width="790"]

=== Auto Complete for Commands

Command words that contain the word input by the user will appear as possible suggestions.
Refer to <<Features>> and <<morefeatures>> for all possible commands.

====
* Command words are always the first word in the input and are only suggested for the first word input.
====

=== Auto Complete for Tags

When the command word `findtag` has been entered, suggestions will display based on
tags that currently exist in Savee's data as tags of other existing records.

Refer to <<findtag>> for
more information on how the `findtag` works.


====
* Any number of tags can be input and every word typed after the command word can bring up the suggestion popup for tags.
====

=== Auto Complete for Sort

When the command word `sort` is entered, suggestion will display based on the possible keyword inputs for the sort function.

Refer to <<sort>> for the sort function keywords.

====
* When a `CATEGORY` has already been entered, the only possible suggestions are `asc` and `desc` as they are the only
`SORT_ORDER possible.
* Likewise, when a `SORT_ORDER` has already been entered, only `CATEGORY` such as `name`, `date` or `money` will be suggested.
* After two words have been keyed in, no other suggestions will be made as `sort` only takes 2 parameters.
====

[[morefeatures]]

// tag::summary[]
== Data Analysis Features

This section describe features for the user to analyse his/her financial status in greater detail.

=== Showing a summary table of all financial activity in a time period: `summary`

Shows a summary table listing by day, month or categories within a given time specified by the user. +
A `summary` is an item that contains information on the *date or month that is represented*, the *total expense calculated*, the *total income calculated* and
the *net money flow calculated.* A `category` refers to any `set of tags` that are assigned to any records in the application. +

The summary command supports both listing by date, by month and by categories. +
Format: +

* By Date: `summary date d/START_DATE END_DATE`
* By Month: `summary month d/START_MONTH END_MONTH`
* By Category: `summary category d/START_DATE END_DATE`

****
* Note that there are specific formats required for the dates and months entered.
* For the commands *"summary date"* and *"summary category"*, START_DATE/END_DATE must be in the format of
`dd-mm-yyyy` where `dd` represents day, `mm` represents month, `yyyy` represents year.
* For command *"summary month"*, START_MONTH/END_MONTH must in the format of `mmm-yyyy`, `mmm` represents the month with its three letter representations, and
`yyyy` represents the year in its numerical form.
* Refer to <<constraints>> for the more information on the parameters.
* Note that for mmm, it is case-insensitive, meaning both *"APR"* and *"apr"* are accepted.
****

Once the command has been executed, a panel will appear showing the summary table containing data that is relevant in the range. +
The table entries are sorted according to either date, month or category depending on the mode used in ascending order. +
At the same time, currently selected record will be unselected to reduce confusion for the user.

[NOTE]
The table listing is currently non-resizable. If either the date, month or category is too long, the default behaviour of this app is to truncate
those words and replace the parts truncated with ellipses("...").

Examples:

* `summary date d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018`
* `summary month d/apr-2018 sep-2018`
* `summary month d/APR-2018 SeP-2018`
* `summary category d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018`

The screenshots below are examples of what you can see once the command has been accepted. The commands entered have been left
in for visualisation purposes. These screenshots are taken in *fullscreen mode*  at 1080p resolution.

image::UiSummaryByDateTable.png[width="790"]
*Screenshot of app when `summary date d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018` is run*

*Screenshot of app when `summary category d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018` is run*

// end::summary[]
// tag::stats[]
=== Showing a breakdown of total expenses and income into categories: `stats`

Shows a breakdown of total expenses and income into categories and displays these information in a pie chart. +
Format:`stats d/START_DATE END_DATE`

****
* START_DATE/END_DATE follow the same configurations as date parameters required when adding records. It is in the form of
*dd-mm-yyyy* where *dd* represents day, *mm* represents month and *yyyy* represents the year. *dd* and *mm* both require 1 to 2 digits while
*yyyy* requires exactly 4 digits.
* Refer to <<constraints>> for the more information on the parameters.
****

Once the command has been executed, 2 tabs will appear showing a pie chart containing data that is relevant in the range. +
At the same time, currently selected record will be unselected to reduce confusion for the user. If there are many categories shown and
the box is not large enough, you can use the scroll bar at the side of each legend to view the other categories which are not in view.

[NOTE]
Due to label constraints, some labels may not be displaying correctly if they are overlapping with other labels. This happens when the pie slice
is too small. To improve readability, we have decided to hide some labels in such scenarios. Also, when the label is too long, since the pie charts
need to fit the labels, the pie chart may become small as a result. To prevent such situations, please keep your labels short. This will be improved in
later versions of the product to remove the labels completely and use a mouse over input instead.

Examples:

* `stats d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018`

Below are some screenshots of what you can see when the command has been accepted. The commands entered have been left
in for visualisation purposes. These screenshots are taken in *fullscreen mode* at 1080p resolution.

image::UiPieChartExpense.png[width="790"]
*Screenshot of app displaying expense breakdown when `stats d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018` is run*

image::UiPieChartIncome.png[width="790"]
*Screenshot of app displaying income breakdown when `stats d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018` is run*

// end::stats[]
// tag::welcomepanel[]
=== Showing a breakdown of total expenses and income into categories of this month: `NO COMMAND REQUIRED TO BE TYPED`

Shows a breakdown of total expenses and income into categories using data of this month. +
No format is required for this feature as the feature is automatically triggered when there is any mutation of data within the application.
Another way of returning to the welcome panel from anywhere in the app is to press `HOME` on the keyboard or click `Home` on the menu.

This feature automatically tracks the *current date* and ensures that the data presented is updated regardless regardless of whether the application is *off* or *on for
prolonged periods of time*. This feature also works offline and retrieves information from the system clock to determine the current date. +

Even in the event where the user is using the application at close to 12 midnight of the last day of a particular month and the clocks strikes 12,
the application will update the data whenever it detects any record data modifications in the app to reflect the next month.

[NOTE]
The data used to represent the pie charts in the welcome panel is *only updated* whenever there are any changes to records within Savee. +
This includes adding records, deleting records and editing records in Savee, but not sorting, listing, summary, stats, etc.

Below shows a snapshot of what the user can see when there are records available of the current month

image::WelcomePanelWithPieCharts.png[width="790"]
*Screenshot of app on startup when records of current month are available*

// end::welcomepanel[]

== Data management features:

This section describe features for the user to manage his/her records data in Savee, with the help of Excel.

// tag::exportexcel[]

=== Export the record data from Financial Planner to the Excel file: `exportexcel`

Exports the records into an Excel file. +

There are 6 modes, default mode, single argument mode and dual argument mode (for Date) and single argument mode (Directory Path). +
Format: +

. Default mode: `exportexcel`
. Single argument Date mode: `exportexcel d/DATE`
. Dual argument Date mode: `exportexcel d/START_DATE END_DATE`
. Single argument Directory Path mode: `exportexcel dir/DIRECTORY_PATH`

****
* *Default mode* will list down all records in Savee and exports all of them to an Excel file and store the file in the default *WORKING DIRECTORY*, it will *detect automatically user's Working Directory*.

* *Single argument Date mode* will list down all records with the specified date and exports all shown records to an Excel file and store the file in the default *WORKING DIRECTORY*, it will *detect automatically user's Working Directory*.

* *Dual argument Date mode* will list down all records with the date that fall on either dates or between both dates and exports all shown records to an Excel file and store the file in the default *Working DIRECTORY*, it will *detect automatically user's Working Directory*.

* *Single argument Directory Path mode* will list down all records in Savee and exports all of them to an Excel file and store the file in the chosen Directory Path.

* *Single argument Date mode + Single argument Directory path mode* will list down all records with the specified date and exports all shown records to an Excel file and store the file in the chosen Directory Path.

* *Dual argument Date mode + Single argument Directory path mode* will list down all records with the date that fall on either dates or between both dates and exports all shown records to an Excel file and store the file in the chosen Directory Path.
+
****

[NOTE]
Date follow the same configurations as date parameters required when adding records. It is in the form of *dd-mm-yyyy* where *dd* represents day, *mm* represents month and *yyyy* represents the year. *dd* and *mm* both require 1 to 2 digits while
*yyyy* requires exactly 4 digits.

Examples:

* `exportexcel`
* `exportexcel d/31-3-1999`
* `exportexcel dir/C:\`
* `exportexcel d/31-3-1999 31-03-2019`
* `exportexcel d/31-3-1999 dir/C:\`
* `exportexcel d/31-3-1999 31-3-2019 dir/C:\`

The Excel file name will be named based on the command, relating to Date: +

* *Default mode*: The Excel file will be named `Financial_Planner_ALL.xlsx`
* *Single argument Date mode*: The Excel file will be named `Financial_Planner_dd-mm-yyyy.xlsx`
* *Dual argument Date*: The Excel file will be named `Financial_Planner_dd-mm-yyyy_dd-mm-yyyy.xlsx`
+

There will be two sheets in the Excel file, namely `RECORD DATA` and `SUMMARY DATA`.

* `RECORD DATA` stores all the data of record the user want to export, there are 4 columns: Name, date, money and tags, the tags names will be separated by ..., for visual benefit.

image::Export_Capture1_LinhChi.png[width:800]

* `SUMMARY DATA` stored the summary statistics for the period you exported, and there is a *Line Chart* next to the table for visual statistic [refer to `Draw a line chart automatically inside the Excel sheet` part for more information].

image::Export_Capture2_LinhChi.png[width:800]

[NOTE]
As the size of the Chart is fixed initially. Sometimes, when user exports too many dates, the distance between each date on the chart might be tight. It is suggesting that the user justify the size of the chart by himself/herself.

// end::exportexcel[]

// tag::import[]

=== Import the record data from the Excel file to the Financial Planner: `import`

There are 2 modes, single argument File Path mode and (single argument Directory Path + single argument File Name) mode +

Format: +

. Single argument File Path mode: `import dir/FILE_PATH` +
. Single argument File Path + single argument File name mode: `import dir/DIRECTORY_PATH  n/NAME_FILE` +

****
* *Single argument File Path mode* will open the Excel file using the given File Path, import all records in Savee and check if these records exist in the Savee, then exports all of non-existent records to Savee.

* *Single argument File Path + single argument File name mode* will open the Excel file using the given Directory path and given file name, import all records in Savee and check if these records exist in Savee, then exports all of non-existent records to Savee.

+
****

Examples:

* `import dir/C:\Financial_Planner_ALL.xlsx`
* `import dir/C:\ n/Financial_Planner_All.xlsx`
* `import dir/C:\ n/Financial_Planner_ALL`

[NOTE]
Please note that User have to add the post-fix `.xlsx` at the end to indicate this is a Excel file (in first and second example).

When performing `import` command to import all the records data from the Excel file to Savee, user should take note that there are some constraints which may help the `import` command performs smoothly.

* The excel file can have multiple sheets, containing records data. The starting row of the table does not have to be first row of the sheet. This also applies to the column.
* There can be blank row blending in the table, but there must be *no* blank column.
* The First row of the table should have 4 cells, namely NAME, DATE, MONEY, TAGS. These 4 columns can be case-insensitive. The sheet with records data but does not have the first row, NAME, DATE, MONEY, TAGS will *not* be read.
* The information of NAME, DATE, MONEY columns should be fully filled, while the TAGS columns is optionally filled.
* Each tag should be separated by ... (3 *consecutive* dots). Beside ... , numbers and alphabet character, there should be no other character.


The picture below shows a good example for the Excel Sheet.

image::Export_Capture1_LinhChi.png[width:800]

// end::import[]

// tag::archive[]

=== Archive the record data from Financial Planner to the Excel file: `archive`

Archives the records into an Excel file. +

There are 6 modes, default mode, single argument mode and dual argument mode (for Date) and single argument mode (Directory Path). +
Format: +

. Default mode: `archive` +
. Single argument Date mode: `archive d/DATE` +
. Dual argument Date mode: `archive d/START_DATE END_DATE`
. Single argument Directory Path mode: `archive dir/DIRECTORY_PATH`
. Single argument Directory Path + Single argument Date mode: `archive d/DATE dir/DIRECTORY_PATH`
. Single argument Directory Path + Dual argument Date mode: `archive d/START_DATE END_DATE dir/DIRECTORY_PATH`

[NOTE]
Date follow the same configurations as date parameters required when adding records. It is in the form of *dd-mm-yyyy* where *dd* represents day, *mm* represents month and *yyyy* represents the year. *dd* and *mm* both require 1 to 2 digits while
*yyyy* requires exactly 4 digits.


The Excel file name will be named based on t
he command, relating to Date: +

* *Default mode*: The Excel file will be named `Financial_Planner_ALL.xlsx`
* *Single argument Date mode*: The Excel file will be named `Financial_Planner_dd-mm-yyyy.xlsx`
* *Dual argument Date*: The Excel file will be named `Financial_Planner_dd-mm-yyyy_dd-mm-yyyy.xlsx`
+

Examples:

* `archive`
* `archive d/31-3-1999`
* `archive dir/C:\`
* `archive d/31-3-1999 31-03-2019`
* `archive d/31-3-1999 dir/C:\`
* `archive d/31-3-1999 31-3-2019 dir/C:\`

There will be two sheets in the Excel file, namely `RECORD DATA` and `SUMMARY DATA`.

* `RECORD DATA` stores all the data of record the user want to archive, there are 4 columns: Name, date, money and tags, the tags names will be separated by ..., for visual benefit.

image::Export_Capture1_LinhChi.png[width:800]

* `SUMMARY DATA` stored the summary statistics for the period you archived, and there is a *Line Chart* next to the table for visual statistic [refer to `Draw a line chart automatically inside the Excel sheet` part for more information].

[NOTE]
As the size of the Chart is fixed initially. Sometimes, when user archive too many dates, the distance between each date on the chart might be tight. It is suggesting that the user justify the size of the chart by himself/herself.

=== Draw a line chart automatically inside the Excel sheet : `NO COMMAND REQUIRED`

Automatically uses the the summary data from the `SUMMARY DATA` sheet in the Excel sheet after the command `archive` or `exportexcel` is called.

As you can see the screenshot below, in the `SUMMARY DATA` sheet, next to the summary table:

image::Export_Capture2_LinhChi.png[width:800]

* On the top left of the chart, the legend shows 3 lines, namely Income, Outcome, and Net.
** The first blue line shows the Income based on Date.
** The second orange line shows the Outcome based on Date
** The third grey line shows the Net (total of income and outcome) based on Date.

== Spending Limit Features

* This section describes the limit feature that allows users to set values to control their future spending.
Constraints that apply to records also apply to each limit. Refer to <<constraints>> for more information.


[[addlimit]]
=== Adding a limit: `addlimit`

Adds a spending limit for a time period or a particular day to Savee. +
Format: `addlimit d/START_DATE END_DATE m/MONEYFLOW` (`limit d/DATE m/MONEYFLOW`)+

When inputting two days, START_DATE and END_DATE indicates the starting date and ending date for the limit.
If there is only one date, that day will be the time period.
MONEYFLOW denotes the money spending limit for that period of time.

* After the limits have been added, Savee will keep checking the latest condition of these limits.
Once the total amount of money spent during this time period exceeds the spending limit,
Savee will warn the user by sending the warning message.
****
* DATE_START must be earlier or equal than DATE_END. When DATE_START and DATE_END are the same, this will be equivalent to single DATE.
* Moneyflow for limit features can only be a positive integer, and does not require a "+" or "-".
* Any date or period of time can only have at most 1 assigned limit.
****

Example:

* `addlimit d/20-8-2018 m/100`
* `addlimit d/20-8-2018 30-8-2018 m/632`
* `addlimit d/20-8-2018 30-8-2018 m/100`

[[checklimit]]
=== Viewing all limits: `checkLimit`

Displays all limits information stored in Savee +
Format: `checklimit`
Example:
* `checklimit`


[[deletelimit]]
=== Deleting a limit: `deleteLimit`

Deletes an existing spending limit from Savee +
Format: `deleteLimit d/START_DATE END_DATE` (`deleteLimit d/START_DATE`) +

The deleting command is based on the date period, since there will be at most one limit
for one period of time, user only need to enter a period of time or a single date. The limit
with the same dates will be deleted. If there is no limit for that period, the program will
throw errors.
Delete
****
* There must be a limit with the same dates.
* Limits cannot be partially deleted with incorrect dates.
****

Examples:

* `deletelimit d/20-8-2018`
* `deletelimit d/20-8-2018 30-8-2018`


[[editlimit]]

=== Editing a limit: `editLimit`

Edit a limit to Savee +
Format: `editLimit d/START_DATE END_DATE m/MONEYFLOW` (`editLimit d/START_DATE END_DATE m/MONEYFLOW`)+

Editlimit is similar to <<deletelimit>> command, it is also based on the date period.
The editlimit command will check the input date period or the single day and
replace the original moneyFlow with the new moneyFlow.
****
* `MONEYFLOW` can only be a positive integer, and does not require a "+" or "-".
* There must be a limit with the same dates.
****

Examples:

* `editlimit d/20-8-2018 m/200`
* `editlimit d/20-8-2018 30-8-2018 m/200`



=== Adding a monthly limit: `addmonthlylimit`

Add a continuous monthly limit always for the current month.
Format: `addmonthlylimit m/MONEYFLOW`

The monthly limit will always check the spend of the current month according to the current time.
For example, if the limit was set to be 200 at April, the limit will check the total spend for April.
When the time comes to May, the limit will no longer check April, instead, the limit
will check the total spend of May until the last second of May.

****
* `MONEYFLOW` can only be a positive integer, and does not require a "+" or "-".
****
Examples:
* `addmonthlylimit m/200`

=== Editing the monthly limit: `editmonthlylimit`

Edit an existing monthly limit.
Format: `editmonthlylimit m/MONEYFLOW`

The monthly limit will be replaced by the new monthly limit.
****
* `MONEYFLOW` can only be a positive integer, and does not require a "+" or "-".
* There must be an existing monthly limit.
****
Examples:
* `editmonthlylimit m/200`

=== Deleting the monthly limit: `deletemonthlylimit`

Delete the monthly limit.
Format: `deletemonthlylimit`

The monthly limit will be deleted and no longer check the spend of the current month.
****
* There must be an existing monthly limit.
****
Examples:
* `deletemonthlylimit`
