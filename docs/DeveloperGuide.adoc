By: `Team T09-4`      Since: `Aug 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.expense.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteRecord.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `FinancialPlannerChangedEvent` when the Financial Planner data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteRecordEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `WelcomePanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `FinancialPlannerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Financial Planner data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Financial Planner`, which `Record` can reference. This would allow `Financial Planner` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the RecordList data in xml format and read it back.
* can save the LimitList data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedFinancialPlanner`.
It extends `FinancialPlanner` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `financialPlannerStateList` and
`currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedFinancialPlanner#commit()` -- Saves the current expense book state in its history.
* `VersionedFinancialPlanner#undo()` -- Restores the previous expense book state from its history.
* `VersionedFinancialPlanner#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone expense book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitFinancialPlanner()`,
`Model#undoFinancialPlanner()` and `Model#redoFinancialPlanner()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedFinancialPlanner` will be initialized with
the initial expense book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single expense planner state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the expense book. The `delete` command calls
`Model#commitFinancialPlanner()`, causing the modified state of the expense book after the `delete 5` command executes
to be saved in the `financialPlannerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted expense book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls
`Model#commitFinancialPlanner()`, causing another modified expense book state to be saved into the
`financialPlannerStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitFinancialPlanner()`, so the expense book state will
not be saved into the `financialPlannerStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the
`undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoFinancialPlanner()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous expense book state, and restores the expense book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial expense book state, then there are no previous
expense book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoFinancialPlanner()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoFinancialPlanner()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer`
once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the expense book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `financialPlannerStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest expense book
state, then there are no undone expense book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoFinancialPlanner()`
to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the expense book, such as
`list`, will usually not call `Model#commitFinancialPlanner()`, `Model#undoFinancialPlanner()` or
`Model#redoFinancialPlanner()`. Thus, the `financialPlannerStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitFinancialPlanner()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `financialPlannerStateList`, all expense book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire expense book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of expense book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedFinancialPlanner`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag:list[]

=== Sort records feature
==== Current Implementation
The sort mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `FinancialPlanner` with a component that sorts the
internal list of records. SortCommand calls `ModelManager#sortFilteredRecordList` and passes in the category to be
sorted by and the sort order.

This feature has one keyword `sort` and takes in arguments of either category or order of sort. Keywords are not
case sensitive.

Category can be either of the following keywords:

* `name` - To sort in lexicographical order by the name attribute of the record
* `date` - To sort by the date attribute of the record
* `money`/`moneyflow` - To sort by the expenditure or income of the record

Order can be either of the following keywords:

* `desc` - To sort in descending order
* `asc` - To sort in ascending order

This feature has 2 different kind of modes as follows:

. Single Argument Mode - Input argument can be either the category or the order of sort
* If category specified, records are sorted in ascending order of that category
* If order specified, records will be sorted by name in the specified order

. Duo Argument Mode - Input arguments must contain only 1 category and only 1 order, and can be input in no particular order

The input given by the user is passed to `SortCommandParser` to split the input separated by whitespaces to ensure
there is either only one or two arguments input by the user. These arguments are stored in an array of strings and
the size of the array determines the mode of the command.

The strings are compared to two sets of strings containing the supported categories and orders of the function.
The string of the category and a boolean representing whether the records are to be reversed will then be passed to
`ModelManager` to sort the records.

Since the displayed list in the UI is a `FilteredList` which is a wrapper for the underlying list `UniqueRecordList` structure,
sorting the internal list of records in `versionedFinancialPlanner` will post an event that notifies the UI to update
the displayed list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width:800]

//tag::list[]

=== List history feature
==== Current Implementation
The list mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`.
It represents an in-memory model of the FinancialPlanner and is the component which manages the interactions between the commands and the `VersionedFinancialPlanner`.
ListCommand calls `ModelManager#updateFilteredRecords` and passes in different predicates depending on the argument mode.

This feature has only one keyword `list` but implements 3 different argument modes to allow users to access multiple versions of the same command.
The three argument modes are as listed below:

* No Argument mode -- Requires no arguments and returns the entire list of records in the FinancialPlanner.
* Single Argument mode -- Requires a single date and returns all records containing that date
* Dual Argument mode -- Requires 2 dates, a `start date` and an `end date`. It returns all records containing dates within the time frame of start date and end date, inclusive of both start date and end date
The mechanism that facilitates these modes can be found in the `ListCommandParser#parse`. Below is a overview of the mechanism:

. The input given by the user is passed to `ArgumentTokeniser#tokenise` to split the input separated by prefixes.
. This returns a `ArgumentMultiMap` which contains a map with prefixes as keys and their associated input arguments as the value.
. The string associated with `d/` is then passed into `ListCommandParser#splitByWhitespace` for further processing and returns an array.
. The argument mode is determined by the size of this array and the elements are further processed into `Date` objects, before creating and returning a `ListCommand` object.

The `ListCommand` has two constructors which makes use of overloading to reduce code complexity.

* One constructor has no arguments and assigns default predicate for the `FilteredList` in `ModelManager`,
`PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_RECORDS` which will show all items in the list.
* The second constructor takes in 2 `Date` arguments and assigns the predicate `DateIsWithinDateIntervalPredicate` which will only show items within the date interval.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works:

image::ListSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

For simplicity, interactions with the UI is not shown in the diagram above. +
The update of the UI `RecordListPanel` is done through the event system. `FilteredList` is a type of ObservableList
implemented by the Java 8 API and it will propagate any changes to the list to any listeners listening to it. This
listener is present in `RecordListPanel` and will update the UI list automatically.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Data structure to support listing of records

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses a FilteredList that is tracked by the UI. FilteredLIst is a wrapper around the ObservableList<Record> that is stored in UniquePersonList which allows for any changes in the observable list to be propagated to the filtered list automatically.
** Pros: Easy to implement
** Cons: May take a significantly longer time to list records if there are many records spanning across a large timeframe.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement a HashMap with Date as the key and Record as the value.
** Pros: Allows for constant time complexity to access any elements. Hence, listing records can potentially be faster.
** Cons: Current UI implementation relies on `FilteredList`. In order for UI to be compatible with the new data structure, the UI may need to change its implementation to `ObservableMap` instead. Alternatively, one can utilise a `HashMap` to first generate the list and pass the list reference into `FilteredList`. However, there is a need to code a filter function.
//end::list[]

//tag::summary[]
=== View summary feature
This feature allows the user to view a summary table of all their financial activity within a period of time. There are 3 different ways the user can
view the summary, one is summary by date which means the summary of each day in the period will be provided, summary by month or summary by category.

The corresponding command required for this feature is `summary` and the user will have to supply 2 dates and a compulsory parameter `mode` which determines whether
they are viewing *summary by date, by month or by category*. This feature involves most components of FinancialPlanner with the exception of `Storage`. It can also be broadly split into
2 phases, the logic phase which generates the summary and the UI phase which allows users to view the summary in a table.

The sequence diagram below details the sequence of program executions for the logic phase.

image::SummarySequenceDiagram.png[width="790"]

. When the user types in the command "summary date d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018", the command is passed fron LogicManager to FinancialPlannerParser. In here,
the system chooses which parser to use which is SummaryCommandParser and calls its parse method which is polymorphic, meaning that every parser has the same function but use different
implementation.
. In this class, based on the `mode` parameter given, the system chooses a SummaryCommand to instantiate and pass the reference back to the Logic Manager. The various checks for the validity of the
parameters also occur during this stage.
. After the SummaryCommandObject is created, `SummaryByDateCommand#execute` is called. The responsibility of SummaryByDateCommand is a manager that has retrieves information from model and passes it to other components.
SummaryByDateCommand gets the filtered list from Model using `Model#getFilteredRecordList` and passes it to the constructor of SummaryByDateList. The creates `SummaryList` object which is then
passed into a `ShowSummaryTableEvent` before trigger.
. The entire logic process is the same for SummaryByMonthCommand and SummaryByCategoryCommand but uses different lists.

The next phase of the program execution is performed in the UI components.

. `MainWindow` will listen out of the `ShowSummaryTableEvent` and render all Main UI panels invisible before rendering `StatsDisplayPanel` visible.
. It then calls the handler function in `StatsDisplayPanel` which will create tabs and call the constructor of `SummaryDisplay`.
. Within the constructor of `SummaryDisplay`, the table is created and the SummaryList is converted into a Ui friendly list.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Method of generating the summary

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Generate the summary list whenever the summary command is called.
** Pros: Easier to implement and maintain. Sufficient for the intended target audience of FinancialPlanner.
** Cons: This requires looping through each record in the filtered record list obtained from the `Model`.
To aid in the time complexity, the internal implementation of SummaryList was done using hash maps instead with allowed for
constant time random access unlike list. However, the initial filtering is close to linear time complexity which could slow down the app if many records are inside.
Also, the list had to be created every time `summary` is called which could be slow if the command is called multiple times.

* **Alternative 2:** Morph the record list into a record hash map of record lists instead
** Pros: A hash map allows for constant random access to a record list of a particular date assuming the key for the hash map is using dates.
Thus, the filtering function does not need to loop through as many records and the time taken would be lower especially when the database in the application is large.
** Cons: Might be too specific to only 1 type of category like categorising by date. If any other types are required, another map may have to be added. This implementation may make the
system rigid and hard to modify in the future. Also, the summary list still had to be generated every time command is called.

* **Alternative 3:** Cache the summary list in financial planner
** Pros: By caching the summary list in the financial planner and assigning a boolean variable along with information on the filter predicate to it to determine if it is modified, we can
reduce the number of times summary list is recreated every time the `summary` command is called. When the `summary` command is called, it checks the
boolean variable to see if summary list needs to be modified. If it doesn't need to be regenerated, the system will simply read directly from `ModelManager`.
** Cons: This implementation involves tracking of the state of the summary list. If it is not done systematically, it may have some hidden bugs which can be hard to test.
Also, if the sequence of commands is as follows, *summary, add, summary*, the time required is still long.

==== Aspect: Method of switching UI panels
* **Alternative 1(current choice):** Disable all UI panels within the Main UI placeholder before enabling the desired one
** Pros: Easy to implement and apply it to other newly created panels. To make use of the current implementation, the panel can simply be the children of
the main Ui placeholder and the event handler can be placed in main window.
** Cons: Might be inefficient when there are many panels or many switching as the same process must be repeated for all panels.
However, this is unrealistic and it is unlikely that there are a lot of UI panels for it to make a significant impact.

* **Alternative 2:** Track which UI panel is visible and only hide that panel
** Pros: Might have some benefits if the amount of resources available is low
** Cons: Slightly harder to implement but unlikely to have visible benefits.
//end::summary[]

//tag::stats[]
=== View category breakdown feature
==== Current Implementation
This feature allows the user to view a pie chart breakdown o
f all expenses and all income within a date range which the user can specify.

The corresponding command required for this feature is `stats`.For this feature, users have to enter 2 dates, one starting date and one ending date.
This feature is facilitated by a few key components of FinancialPlanner, `Logic`, `Model`, `UI` and function executions can be split into 2 phases, the `Logic phase` and the `UI phase`.
The detailed execution sequence of functions used for `Logic phase` are as shown below.

image::StatisticLogicSequenceDiagram.png[width="790"]

Consider the situation where the user enters *"stats d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018"*:

* When user enters the command, the `LogicManager` recognises the command and calls the `FinancialPlannerParser` to process the new command as shown above.
* The FinancialPlannerParser will then search for the `stats` keyword required and once it is found, the rest of the command minus the keyword is passed in as a
parameter to StatisticCommandParser.
* The StatisticCommandParser will then parse the arguments and create a new StatisticCommand object before returning its reference. The activity diagram below details the mechanism
within the `StatisticCommandParser#parse` method.

image::StatisticParserActivityDiagram.png[width="500"]

* Once `StatisticCommand#execute` is called, it will then search through the in-memory data of FinancialPlanner and return a list containing all records within the date range and including
both the start dates and end dates. This functionality is facilitated by the `ModelManager` which is the class that manages all interactions between
`Logic` and `Model` component, by`ModelManager#updateFilteredRecords`. The command then retrieves the filteredList from ModelManager and passes it into
the constructor of `CategoryStatisticsList`.
* In this constructor, it will loop through all the records in the list and add them into an internal map. The internal data structure in `CategoryStatisticsList` is a hash map,
to aid in the adding process, however it only outputs lists and not the map. This functionality is facilitated by `CategoryStatisticsList#addToCategoryStatistics` which checks whether the record
is in the map.
* If the record is not present, it creates a new `CategoryStatistic` object and adds that to the map. If the record is present, the record is then added to the existing `CategoryStatistic` object.
* The flow of control returns to StatisticCommand and StatisticCommand calls the read function of CategoryStatisticsList to obtain a read-only list and passes it into
an event constructor before posting the event `ShowPieChartStatsEvent`.

After the event is posted, the execution proceeds to the `UI phase` where there is a listener in `MainWindow` listening to this event. This is facilitated by
the event system in FinancialPlanner. The sequence diagram below details the program flow of the functions executed in `UI phase`.

image::StatisticUiSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

* When the event is caught by the listener in `MainWindow`, `MainWindow` looks through all children of the `MainWindow#mainUiPanelPlaceholder` and executes the hide function in them.
This will make all children hidden from view in the UI which ensures that the UI is displayed correctly.
* As shown above, the function `StatsDisplayPanel#handleShowPieChartDataEvent` is called which will call the constructor of `MixedPieChartData`. The detailed execution details within this class is as shown in
the activity diagram below.

image::StatisticUiActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

The program flow is then as shown above where the `CategoryBreakdown` is created and instantiated with 2 lists, one being expenseLabelData and other being expenseLegendData.
In the current implementation, whenever `stats` is called, 2 tabs will be created, one for total income and one for total expense. Thus, the same program sequence after construction for
`CategoryBreakdown` is also repeated for total income.

The sequence diagram below details the program flow after the constructor of CategoryBreakdown class is called.

image::StatisticUiDetailedSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note that the CustomLegend class is located within the CustomPieChart class which inherits from the JavaFX PieChart class. This legend class can
only be accessed within CustomPieChart for security purposes.

The findtag mechanism is also facilitated by `ModelManager`. FindTagCommand calls `ModelManager#updateFilteredRecords`
and passes in different predicates depending on the input by the user.

This feature has only one keyword `findtag` and a single working mode which takes in any number of input arguments. The
input given by the user is passed to `FindTagCommandParser#parse` to split the desired tags the user wants to search by
into an array of strings. The array of strings is passed into `TagsContainsKeywordsPredicate` to create the predicate
for `updateFilteredRecordList` required in `ModelManager`.

In `TagsContainsKeywordsPredicate`, to compare for a match, every keyword in the array is compared
against the set of tags of each record and as long as any tag matches any of the keywords,
the predicate will evaluate to true and allows the `FilteredList` to filter out the records that do not fulfil the
predicate.

`FindTagCommandParser` returns a `FindTagCommand` object which calls `updateFilteredRecordList` to set the new predicate
and obtain a new `filteredRecords` based on the predicate, which will also trigger an event for the UI to read in and display the new records.

The following sequence diagram shows how the limit operation works:

// tag::addlimit[]

=== addLimit feature
==== Current Implementation
The limit command is based on the data type "Date", which includes two dates and "moneyFlow".
When the user try to enter only one date, the parser will let the date be both dateStart and dateEnd.
It is equivalent to entering two same dates.
Once the user execute the limit command, the Limit will be stored inside the LimitList.xml file by
calling the function model.add(limit). The input limit will be serialized and stored.
Whenever the user change the recordList information, including adding a record, deleting a record
and editing a record, all the limits will be checked automatically by calling the function model.autoLimitCheck,
this function will generate a string which contains all the exceeded limits' information will be printed
out to warn the user that they have overspent their money.

The user enter two dates after the one "d/" index followed by money with m/ index.
The user need to input two dates(or one date), the first one is dateStart while the second one is dateEnd.
The dateStart must be earlier or equals to dateEnd, otherwise, the program will throw error.
The user also need to input the limit money they want to set. Unlike the moneyFlow used
by addCommand, the limit moneyFlow can only be normal real number, which does not have "-" or
"+" in front of the number. After user input the normal real number, the parser will add a "-"
at the beginning of the real number, which makes it a normal moneyFlow.
If user input wrong form of limit moneyFlow, the program will throw error.


The input given by the user is passed to `ArgumentTokeniser#tokenise` to split the input separated by prefixes.
. This returns a `ArgumentMultiMap` which contains a map with prefixes as keys and their associated input arguments as the value.
. The string associated with `d/` is then passed into `LimitCommandParser#splitByWhitespace` for further processing and returns an array.
This string will be split into two strings and each of them will be construct as a date type variable.
. After parsing the two dates, the parser will check whether the dateStart is small
. The argument mode is determined by the size of this array and the elements are further processed into `Date` objects, before creating and returning a `ListCommand` object.

The following sequence diagram shows how the limit operation works:

image::LimitSequenceDiagram.png[width:800]
// end::addlimit[]
// tag::deleteLimit[]
=== deleteLimit feature
==== Current Implementation
deleteLimit will delete the limit inside the limitList according to the dates input. The user inputs
two dates, dateStart and dateEnd, and the parser will make it a limit which has a dummy money.
Similar to the addLimit feature, the parser will set the dateStart and dateEnd same date if the user input only one date.
Then call the getSameDatesLimit() to get the limit with the same dates. Afterwards, the command will
call deleteLimit(sameDatesLimit) to delete the limit.

The user enter two dates (or one date) after the one "d/" index.
The user need to input two dates, the first one is dateStart while the second one is dateEnd.
The dateStart must be earlier or equals to dateEnd, otherwise, the program will throw error.
If there is no limits inside the limitList has the same dates, the program will throw an error.


The input given by the user is passed to `ArgumentTokeniser#tokenise` to split the input separated by prefixes.
. This returns a `ArgumentMultiMap` which contains a map with prefixes as keys and their associated input arguments as the value.

The following sequence diagram shows how the deleteLimit operation works:

image::deleteLimitSequenceDiagram.png[width:800]
// end::deleteLimit[]
// tag::editLimit[]
=== editLimit feature
==== Current Implementation
The editLimit command is similar to limit command, has dateStart, dateEnd and moneyFlow.
The command will do the replacement by deleting the limit with same dates and add the new limit by calling model.updateLimit().
The parser will return the new limit and check whether there is a limit sharing the same dates. If there is a limit, it will
change the replace the original limit with the new limit. If there is no limit with


The user enter two dates after the one "d/" index followed by money with m/ index.
The user need to input two dates, the first one is dateStart while the second one is dateEnd.
Similar to the addLimit feature, the parser will set the dateStart and dateEnd same date if the user input only one date.
The dateStart must be earlier or equals to dateEnd, otherwise, the program will throw error.
If there is no limits inside the limitList has the same dates, the program will throw an error.
The user also need to input the limit money they want to reset. The money has the same requirement as addLimit command.


The input given by the user is passed to `ArgumentTokeniser#tokenise` to split the input separated by prefixes.
. This returns a `ArgumentMultiMap` which contains a map with prefixes as keys and their associated input arguments as the value.
. The string associated with `d/` is then passed into `editLimitCommandParser#splitByWhitespace` for further processing and returns an array.
This string will be split into two strings and each of them will be construct as a date type variable.
. After parsing the two dates, the parser will check whether the dateStart is small
. The argument mode is determined by the size of this array and the elements are further processed into `Date` objects, before creating and returning a `ListCommand` object.

The following sequence diagram shows how the limit operation works:

image::editLimitSequenceDiagram.png[width:800]
// end::editLimit[]
=== addMonthlyLimit feature
==== Current Implementation
The addMonthlyLimit command is to add a continuous limit always for this month. The limit will always check
the spend of the month according to the current time. For example, if the limit was set to be 200 at April, the
limit will check the total spend for April. When the time comes to May, the limit will no longer check April, instead, the limit
will check the total spend of May until the last second of May. The user will input only the money they want to set.
The parser will make the limit with a special date "01-01-9999", which is not likely to be used. Then call the model.addLimit() function
to add the limit. Once the limit is going to be checked, the function generateThisMonthLimit() will be called, which
will generate a new limit according to the current date. Then use this date to do the limit check and generate output.

Unlike the moneyFlow used
by addCommand, the limit moneyFlow can only be normal real number, which does not have "-" or
"+" in front of the number. After user input the normal real number, the parser will add a "-"
at the beginning of the real number, which makes it a normal moneyFlow.
If user input wrong form of limit moneyFlow, the program will throw error.

The input given by the user is passed to `ArgumentTokeniser#tokenise` to split the input separated by prefixes.
. This returns a `ArgumentMultiMap` which contains a map with prefixes as keys and their associated input arguments as the value.
. The parser will generate the limit with special date and the moneyFlow according to the user input.

// tag::checkLimit[]
=== checkLimit feature
==== Current Implementation
This feature is to help the user to check all the limits stored inside the limitList. The function will call
manualLimitCheck(), which will generate a string that contains all limits' information.

When there is no limits inside the limitList, the program will throw an error.

The following sequence diagram shows how the limit operation works:

image::checkLimitSequenceDiagram.png[width:800]
// end::checkLimit[]
// end::limitfeatures[]

// tag::delete_by_date_entry[]

=== Delete By Date Entry
==== Current implementation
The delete by date entry mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`.
It represents an in-memory model of the FinancialPlanner and is the component which manages the interactions between the commands and the `VersionedFinancialPlanner`.

DeleteByDateEntryCommand calls `ModelManager#getFilteredRecordList` to retrieve the list of all current records in the Financial Planner. Then, it will loop through the list of records and call `ModelManger#deleteRecord(Record record)` to delete the record whose date is required.

If there exists target records, `ModelManager#commitFinancialPlanner` will be called to update the current version of Financial Planner and the message, which states records have been deleted. Then, `ModelManager#autoLimitCheck` will be called to check the current change in limit as we delete some records exceeds the limit or not.

This feature has only one keyword `delete_date` and implements only 1 argument mode.
The three argument modes are as listed below:

* Single Argument mode -- Requires only one date. It deletes all records whose date is required.
The date must follow the format: dd-mm-yyyy, error will be thrown if the format is not correct or the date entered is not real.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works:

image::DeleteByDateEntrySequenceDiagram.png[width:800]

// end::delete_by_date_entry[]

// tag::export_excel[]
=== Export into Excel file
==== Current implementation
The export into excel file mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager` with the help of `ExcelUtil`, the utility created to handle all methods relating to Excel. It represents an in-memory model of the FinancialPlanner and is the component which manages the interactions between the commands, `ExcelUtil` and the `VersionedFinancialPlanner`.

ExportExcelCommand calls `ModelManager#updateFilteredRecords` and passes in different predicates depending on the argument mode. The List<Record> is retrieved by calling `ModelManager#getFilteredRecordList`.

Meanwhile, it also called `ModelManager#getFinancialPlanner` to get the `ReadOnlyFinancialPlanner` Financial Planner.

The SummaryByDateList is constructed after the ReadOnlyFinancialPlanner together with the predicate are passed into the construction of SummaryByDateList. The List<SummaryEntry> is easily retrieved from SummaryByDateList by calling `SummaryByDateList#getSummaryList`.

`ExcelUtil#setNameExcelFile` is called to make the Excel name based on the condition of startDate and endDate.

After that, `ExcelUtil#setPathFile` is called to set the Path file, which is the location of the Excel file stored in future. The Path file is constructed based on the name of the Excel file we retrieve above and the directory Path, it can be either optionally entered by the user or the default User's Home Directory.

With the sufficient information, `List<Record> records`, `List<SummaryByDateEntry> summaryList`, `file path`, `ExportExcelCommand#exportDataIntoExcelSheetWithGivenRecords` is called to start the processing of producing Excel file, containing 2 Excel sheet, namely `RECORD DATA` and `SUMMARY DATA`.

* `RECORD DATA` stores all the data of record the user want to export, there are 4 columns: Name, date, money and tags, the tags names will be separated by ..., for visual benefit.

image::Export_Capture1_LinhChi.png[width:800]

* `SUMMARY DATA` stored the summary statistics for the period you exported, and there is a *Line Chart* next to the table for visual statistic [refer to `Draw line chart` part for more information]. As you can see in the picture, there are 3 series shown:
** The first blue line named Income represents the relation between Timeline (each component is one Date) and the Income (each component is one income).
** The second orange line named Outcome represents the relation between Timeline (each component is one Date) and the Outcome (each component is one outcome).
** The third grey line named Net represents the relation Timeline (each component is one Date) and the Net - Sum of income and outcome (each component is one net).

image::Export_Capture2_LinhChi.png[width:800]

This feature has only one keyword `export_excel` but implements 6 different argument modes to allow users to access multiple versions of the same command.
The six argument modes are as listed below:

* *No argument mode* `export_excel` will list down all records in the Financial Planner and exports all of them to an Excel file and store the file in the default *HOME DIRECTORY*, it will *detect automatically User's Home Directory*.

* *Single argument Date mode* `export_excel d/DATE` will list down all records with the specified date and exports all shown records to an Excel file and store the file in the default *HOME DIRECTORY*, it will *detect automatically user's Home Directory*.

* *Dual argument Date mode* `export_excel d/START_DATE END_DATE` will list down all records with the date that fall on either dates or between both dates and exports all shown records to an Excel file and store the file in the default *HOME DIRECTORY*, it will *detect automatically User's Home Directory*.

* *Single argument Directory Path mode* `export_excel dir/DIRECTORY_PATH` will list down all records in the Financial Planner and exports all of them to an Excel file and store the file in the chosen Directory Path.

* *Single argument Date mode + Single argument Directory path mode* `export_excel d/DATE dir/DIRECTORY_PATH` will list down all records with the specified date and exports all shown records to an Excel file and store the file in the chosen Directory Path.

* *Dual argument Date mode + Single argument Directory path mode* `export_excel d/START_DATE END_DATE dir/DIRECTORY_PATH` will list down all records with the date that fall on either dates or between both dates and exports all shown records to an Excel file and store the file in the chosen Directory Path.
+

The mechanism that facilitates these modes can be found in the `ExportExcelCommandParser#parse`. Below is a overview of the mechanism:

. Method `ExportExcelCommandParser#createExportExcelCommand` takes the input argument and further analyse it.
. The input given by the user is passed to `ArgumentTokeniser#tokenise` to split the input separated by prefixes.
. This returns a `ArgumentMultiMap` which contains a map with prefixes as keys and their associated input arguments as the value.
. The string associated with `d/`
.. It is then passed into `ExportExcelCommandParser#splitByWhitespace` for further processing and returns an array. This string will be split into sub-strings and each of them will be construct as a date type variable. The the size of the array exceed 2, error wil be thrown to inform invalid command format.
.. If the size of the string equals 1, it is constructed as a date type variable after being passed to `ParseUtil#parseDate`, it must follow the format dd-mm-yyyy. Error will be thrown if the format is not correct or the date entered is not real.
.. If the size of the string equals 2, each sub-string is constructed as a date type variable after being passed to `ParseUtil#parseDate`, and an additional check is conducted to check if the first date entered, known as Start date is smaller than the second date entered, known as End Date.
. The String associated with `dir/`
.. It is then passed into `ParseUtil#parseDirectoryString` to check if the Directory path given is existing.
.. If the Directory is unreal, an error is thrown to inform the user.
. Please take note that:
.. If the prefix `d/` is not entered in the input, meaning that all the records will be included in the Excel sheet.
.. If the prefix `dir/` is not entered in the input, meaning that the Directory Path is default as the *User's Home Directory*.

The `ExportExcelCommand` has four constructors which makes use of overloading to reduce code complexity.

* One constructor has no arguments and assigns default predicate for the `FilteredList` in `ModelManager`,
`PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_RECORDS` which will show all items in the list and the Directory path is *User's Home Directory*.
* The second constructor takes in 2 `Date` arguments and assigns the predicate `DateIsWithinDateIntervalPredicate` which will only show items within the date interval and the Directory path is *User's Home Directory*.
* The third constructor takes in 1 `Directory Path` argument and assigns the predicate as `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_RECORDS`, which will show all items in the list and the Directory path is the entered directory path.
* The fourth constructor takes in 1 `Directory Path` and 2 `Date` arguments and assigns the predicate as `DateIsWithinDateIntervalPredicate` which will only show items within the date interval and the Directory path is the entered Directory Path.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works:

image::ExportExcelSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

For simplicity, interactions with the UI is not shown in the diagram above. +
The update of the UI `RecordListPanel` is done through the event system. `FilteredList` is a type of ObservableList
implemented by the Java 8 API and it will propagate any changes to the list to any listeners listening to it. This
listener is present in `RecordListPanel` and will update the UI list automatically.

// end::export_excel[]

// tag::import[]

=== Import from Excel file
==== Current implementation
The import from Excel file mechanism is facilitated by `ExcelUtil`, the utility created to handle all method relating to Excel.

ImportExcelCommand calls `ExcelUtil#readExcelSheet` to read the Excel file and retrieve data of records from them to create a list of record List<Record>.

After that, `ModelManager#addListUniqueRecord` is called to add the records in the List<Record>. If the record has already existed in the Financial Planner, it will be ignored and not added into the Financial Planner.

Eventually, when all the records are added in the Financial Planner, `ModelManager#commitFinancialPlanner` will be called to update the current version of Financial Planner and the message, which states records have been added.

This feature has only one keyword `archive` but implements 2 different argument modes to allow users to access multiple versions of the same command.
The two argument modes are as listed below:

* *Single argument File Path mode* `import dir/FILE_PATH` will open the Excel file using the given File Path, import all records in the Financial Planner and check if these records exist in the Financial Planner, then exports all of non-existent records to Financial Planner.

* *Single argument File Path + single argument File name mode* `import dir/DIRECTORY_PATH  n/NAME_FILE` will open the Excel file using the given Directory path and given file name, import all records in the Financial Planner and check if these records exist in the Financial Planner, then exports all of non-existent records to Financial Planner.
+

The mechanism that facilitates these modes can be found in the `ImportExcelCommandParser#parse`. Below is a overview of the mechanism:

. Method `ImportExcelCommandParser#createArchiveCommand` takes the input argument and further analyse it.
. The input given by the user is passed to `ArgumentTokeniser#tokenise` to split the input separated by prefixes.
. This returns a `ArgumentMultiMap` which contains a map with prefixes as keys and their associated input arguments as the value.

. The String associated with `dir/`
.. It is then passed into `ParseUtil#parseDirectoryString` to check if the Directory path given is existing.
.. If the Directory is unreal, an error is thrown to inform the user.

. The String associated with `n/`
.. It is then passed into `ExcelUtil#getPathFile` together with the String associated with `dir/` to create the File Path.
.. The File Path is then passed into `ParseUtil#parseFilePathString` to check if the File path given is existing.
.. If the File Path is unreal, an error is thrown to inform the user.
. Please take note that:
.. The String associated with `dir/` *must* be entered.
.. The String associated with `n/` is optionally entered.
.. Please note that User have to add the post-fix `.xlsx` at the end to indicate this is a Excel file.

When performing `import` command to import all the records data from the Excel file to the Financial Planner, user should take note that there are some constraints which helps the `import` command performs smoothly.

* The excel file can have multiple sheets, containing records data. The starting row of the table does not have to be first row of the sheet. This also applies to the column.
* There can be blank row blending in the table, but there must be *no* blank column.
* The First row of the table *must* have 4 cells, namely NAME, DATE, MONEY, TAGS. These 4 columns can be case-insensitive. The sheet with records data but does not have the first row, NAME, DATE, MONEY, TAGS will *not* be read.
* The information of NAME, DATE, MONEY columns should be fully filled, while the TAGS columns is optionally filled.
* Each tag should be separated by ... (3 *consecutive* dots). Beside ... , numbers and alphabet character, there should be no other character.

The picture below shows a good example for the Excel Sheet.

image::Export_Capture1_LinhChi.png[width:800]


The `ImportExcelCommand` has only one constructor.

* The constructor takes in file path argument and read the Excel file using that file path. After that, all the record data in the Excel file is retrieved and transform into Record object. The list of records are then added into the Model by using `ModelManager#addListUniqueRecord`

It represents an in-memory model of the FinancialPlanner and is the component which manages the interactions between the commands, `ExcelUtil` and the `VersionedFinancialPlanner`.

ArchiveCommand calls `ModelManager#updateFilteredRecords` and passes in different predicates depending on the argument mode. The List<Record> is retrieved by calling `ModelManager#getFilteredRecordList`.

Meanwhile, it also called `ModelManager#getFinancialPlanner` to get the `ReadOnlyFinancialPlanner` Financial Planner.

The SummaryByDateList is constructed after the ReadOnlyFinancialPlanner together with the predicate are passed into the construction of SummaryByDateList. The List<SummaryEntry> is easily retrieved from SummaryByDateList by calling `SummaryByDateList#getSummaryList`.

With the sufficient information, `List<Record> records`, `List<SummaryByDateEntry> summaryList`, `file path`, `ArchiveCommand#archiveDataIntoExcelSheetWithGivenRecords` is called to start the processing of producing Excel file, containing 2 Excel sheet, namely `RECORD DATA` and `SUMMARY DATA`.

* `RECORD DATA` stores all the data of record the user want to archive, there are 4 columns: Name, date, money and tags, the tags names will be separated by ..., for visual benefit.

image::Export_Capture1_LinhChi.png[width:800]

* `SUMMARY DATA` stored the summary statistics for the period you archived, and there is a *Line Chart* next to the table for visual statistic [refer to `Draw line chart` part for more information]. As you can see in the picture, there are 3 series shown:
** The first blue line named Income represents the relation between Timeline (each component is one Date) and the Income (each component is one income).

** The third grey line named Net represents the relation Timeline (each component is one Date) and the Net - Sum of income and outcome (each component is one net).

After records are archived to Excel file, `ModelManager#deleteListRecord` is called to delete the archived records.If there exists target records, `ModelManager#commitFinancialPlanner` will be called to update the current version of Financial Planner and the message, which states records have been deleted.

* *Single argument Directory Path mode* `archive dir/DIRECTORY_PATH` will list down all records in the Financial Planner and archives all of them to an Excel file and store the file in the chosen Directory Path.

* *Single argument Date mode + Single argument Directory path mode* `archive d/DATE dir/DIRECTORY_PATH` will list down all records with the specified date and archives all shown records to an Excel file and store the file in the chosen Directory Path.

* *Dual argument Date mode + Single argument Directory path mode* `archive d/START_DATE END_DATE dir/DIRECTORY_PATH` will list down all records with the date that fall on either dates or between both dates and archives all shown records to an Excel file and store the file in the chosen Directory Path.

=== Design Considerations
==== Aspect: Data structure to support listing of records

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses a FilteredList that is tracked by the UI. FilteredLIst is a wrapper around the ObservableList<Record> that is stored in UniquePersonList which allows for any changes in the observable list to be propagated to the filtered list automatically.
** Pros: Easy to implement
** Cons: May take a significantly longer time to list records if there are many records spanning across a large timeframe.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement a HashMap with Date as the key and Record as the value.
** Pros: Allows for constant time complexity to access any elements. Hence, listing records can potentially be faster.
** Cons: Current UI implementation relies on `FilteredList`. In order for UI to be compatible with the new data structure, the UI may need to change its implementation to `ObservableMap` instead. Alternatively, one can utilise a `HashMap` to first generate the list and pass the list reference into `FilteredList`. However, there is a need to code a filter function.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.expense.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.expense.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.expense.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.expense.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Financial Planner depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/logic/parser/FinancialPlannerParser.java[`FinancialPlannerParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/logic/parser/FinancialPlannerParser.java[`FinancialPlannerParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the expense book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the expense book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/model/FinancialPlanner.java[`FinancialPlanner`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/model/FinancialPlanner.java[`FinancialPlanner`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/model/FinancialPlanner.java[`FinancialPlanner`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/model/FinancialPlanner.java[`FinancialPlanner`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `FinancialPlanner#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your expense book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/FinancialPlannerSystemTest.java[`FinancialPlannerSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and FinancialPlannerSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the expense book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleFinancialPlannerChangedEvent(FinancialPlannerChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/FinancialPlannerSystemTest.java[`FinancialPlannerSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the expense book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the expense book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the expense book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupFinancialPlanner(ReadOnlyFinancialPlanner)`, so that the expense book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/storage/FinancialPlannerStorage.java[`FinancialPlannerStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/storage/XmlFinancialPlannerStorage.java[`XmlFinancialPlannerStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/logic/parser/FinancialPlannerParser.java[`FinancialPlannerParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/expense/logic/parser/FinancialPlannerParserTest.java[`FinancialPlannerParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/logic/parser/FinancialPlannerParser.java[`FinancialPlannerParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/expense/logic/parser/FinancialPlannerParserTest.java[`FinancialPlannerParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `financialPlanner.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonFinancialPlanner.xml`, `typicalPersonsFinancialPlanner.xml`, `validFinancialPlanner.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/expense/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/expense/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/expense/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expense/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/expense/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
