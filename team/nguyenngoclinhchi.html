<div class="paragraph">
<p>In semester 1 year 2, I had a chance to learn NUS CS2113T - Software Engineering and Object Oriented Programming module. Thanks to this module, I had an hand-on experience to develop a desktop application with my teammate. Guidelines are given during 10 weeks to assist us create the application focusing on a particular group of users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>4 - 5 students from all walk of life are assigned to one group. We adjust each other working style within few weeks and support each other to develop the project. Be it minor enhancement or major enhancement, we are expected to contribute to the team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Initially, a source code <a href="https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/addressbook-level4/">AddressBook Level 4</a> is given to us at the beginning of the CS2113T module. This has about 10 kLoc (10,000 lines of code). Choosing the morphing direction, we were tasked to modify the existing code into other software we opted to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We would be evaluated based on our ability to work with existing base code and the quality of our new enhancements to
the existing code. Besides code, we were expected to write a User Guide and Developer Guide as well for the product
as though we were releasing an official product for public usage to simulate an actual work schedule.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Savee&#8217;s target is for everyone who needs help to manage their financial status, but we focus mainly on <strong>students</strong>. As a NUS student, I understand how great impact finance can impose on a student. With this application, I and my teammates hope to bring positive support to users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This application is perfectly designed for users who like typing and are proficient in organizing their data with command line interface (CLI). User can store <code>name</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>money flow</code>, and optional <code>tag</code>. With 3 compulsory components, namely, <code>name</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>money flow</code>, we create a <code>Record</code>. The <code>date</code> component refers to the actual date when the financial activity is performed and <code>money flow</code> component refers to the income or expenditure of the user on the specific date. Typing might be time-consuming but it allows user have a glimpse back to the expense user spent or received. Hence, the user will have a chance to recall their expenses as well as be more aware about their financial status.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Locating at the topmost of the Savee application is the text box, which user can use to type the command into the system. Graphic User Interface (GUI) created by JavaFX is the main component used to display output of the system to create a instinctive and engaging user experience.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Milestone is set every fortnight. Be it minor enhancement or major enhancement, every member is expected to contribute to the project every milestone. Working as a team, I am so happy to see the development of my teammate, and also satisfied to see myself grow through the progress.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A summary of my contributions is given below.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="enhancement-related-contributions"><a class="link" href="#enhancement-related-contributions">Enhancement-related contributions:</a></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Major enhancements</em></strong>: Assisted morph the AddressBook4 to Savee.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for enhancement</code>: Different from the AddressBook4, which stores the contact data, our app mainly aims supporting users who prefer to keep track of their daily financial activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Overview</code>: Significant effort is required to morph this application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Highlights</code>: This major enhancement requires large amount of time as I have to read through all 10 kLoc and understand them before making any modifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code>: I refactored function together with variables across classes, to make these components compatible and consistent for the application. Along the way I developed my code, I had to adjust to the new structure of the Savee, as not only we did rename the variable, methods, classes, we also build up our own structure for the application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Major enhancements</em></strong>: Added the feature that allows the user delete all the record whose date is required.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for enhancement</code>: As this application is designed for daily expense/income management and in case when user type in wrong date at the beginning. This feature allows user to delete multiple records at the same time, compared to the original delete one record at the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Overview</code>: I developed this enhancement with the hope to increase the user-friendliness of the application by decreasing the time spent on delete feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Highlights</code>: This major enhancement was simple to code but unexpectedly difficult to debug as it requires a in-depth knowledge for the Internal List structure building up the list of records, and pointer when looping through the list and deleting records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code>: I wrote the code for the command, parser, and tests, and modify other classes and codes to adjust when a new command is added.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Major enhancements</em></strong>: Added the feature that allows the user archive the record data from Savee to the Excel file.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for enhancement</code>: As the user has used the application long time, the memory made up this application will be very large. Hence, it will impose a memory burden on the computer. It would be great that we can archive this data and store them in different location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Overview</code>: The feature allows users to archive the data in excel file, this <strong>Excel file</strong> can be saved to other places, such as computer drive, google drive, one drive,&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Highlights</code>: This major enhancement requires significant effort and time, as initially, the library is not included in Java 10 library, I have to read the documentation as well as learn how to utilize the library in the short time. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider this feature as <strong>advanced</strong> feature. Moreover, I put effort on designing a user-friendly Excel file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code>: This feature takes in <strong>6 different input mode</strong>. Every possible input is taken into consideration and I have to make sure that there is no error thrown for all  possible inputs. As the number of possible cases are quite large, time spent on this feature are mainly testing and debugging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Credits</code>: Apache Poi Library and its inner class were used and modified to fit into the feature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Major enhancements</em></strong>: Added the feature that allows the user import the record data from the Excel file to the Savee.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for enhancement</code>: When the user archive or export record data into Excel file. They can import these record data back automatically. The number of sheets in Excel file should not be limited and the application will import as many as Excel sheets in the file if found eligible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Overview</code>: The feature allows user to import the record data from the Excel file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Highlights</code>: This major enhancement requires significant effort and time, as initially, the library is not included in Java 10 library, I have to read the documentation as well as learn how to utilize the library in the short time. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider this feature as <strong>advanced</strong> feature. Moreover, I have to consider to check the existence of the directory path of the Excel file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code>: This feature takes in <strong>2 different input modes</strong>. I have to set up the Directory check to make sure that the Directory given is existing and the Excel file is clearly created. There are some pre-conditions for the Excel file to be successfully imported [refer to the User guide <strong>Import the record data from the Excel file to the Savee</strong> part].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Credits</code>: Apache Poi Library and its inner class were used and modified to fit into the feature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Major enhancements</em></strong>: Added the feature that allows the user export the record data from Savee to the Excel file.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for enhancement</code>: Since the our application is only used on one device. Hence, the data cannot be shared directly. I want to offer help for users wanting to share the record data to their friends, family members,&#8230;&#8203; by implementing the Export Excel feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Overview</code>: This feature allows user export data into Excel file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Highlights</code>: This major enhancement requires significant effort and time, as initially, the library is not included in Java 10 library, I have to read the documentation as well as learn how to utilize the library in the short time.

</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Minor enhancement</em></strong>: Added the feature that automatically draw a line chart in the Excel file.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for enhancement</code>: Since the <strong>export the record data from Savee to the Excel file</strong> feature and <strong>archive the record data from Savee to the Excel file</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Overview</code>: This feature will draw a line chart about the summary of Income, Outcome, and Net based on Date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Highlights</code>: This major enhancement requires significant effort and time, as initially, the library is not included in Java 10 library, I have to read the documentation as well as learn how to utilize the library in the short time. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider this feature as <strong>advanced</strong> feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code>: This feature does not take in any input, as it will be automatically drawn after the Excel file is created, meaning that user enter the <code>exportexcel</code> commmand or <code>archive</code> command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Credits</code>: Apache Poi Library and its inner class were used and modified to fit into the feature.</p>

<p>After records are archived to Excel file, <code>ModelManager#deleteListRecord</code> is called to delete the archived records.If there exists target records, <code>ModelManager#commitFinancialPlanner</code> will be called to update the current version of Financial Planner and the message, which states records have been deleted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The mechanism that facilitates these modes can be found in the <code>ArchiveCommandParser#parse</code>. Below is a overview of the mechanism:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Method <code>ArchiveCommandParser#createArchiveCommand</code> takes the input argument and further analyse it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The input given by the user is passed to <code>ArgumentTokeniser#tokenise</code> to split the input separated by prefixes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This returns a <code>ArgumentMultiMap</code> which contains a map with prefixes as keys and their associated input arguments as the value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The string associated with <code>d/</code></p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>It is then passed into <code>ArchiveCommandParser#splitByWhitespace</code> for further processing and returns an array. This string will be split into sub-strings and each of them will be construct as a date type variable. The the size of the array exceed 2, error wil be thrown to inform invalid command format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the size of the string equals 1, it is constructed as a date type variable after being passed to <code>ParseUtil#parseDate</code>, it must follow the format dd-mm-yyyy. Error will be thrown if the format is not correct or the date entered is not real.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the size of the string equals 2, each sub-string is constructed as a date type variable after being passed to <code>ParseUtil#parseDate</code>, and an additional check is conducted to check if the first date entered, known as Start date is smaller than the second date entered, known as End Date.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The String associated with <code>dir/</code></p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>It is then passed into <code>ParseUtil#parseDirectoryString</code> to check if the Directory path given is existing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Directory is unreal, an error is thrown to inform the user.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please take note that:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>If the prefix <code>d/</code> is not entered in the input, meaning that all the records will be included in the Excel sheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the prefix <code>dir/</code> is not entered in the input, meaning that the Directory Path is default as the <strong>User&#8217;s Working Directory</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>ArchiveCommand</code> has four constructors which makes use of overloading to reduce code complexity.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>One constructor has no arguments and assigns default predicate for the <code>FilteredList</code> in <code>ModelManager</code>,
<code>PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_RECORDS</code> which will show all items in the list and the Directory path is <strong>User&#8217;s Working Directory</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second constructor takes in 2 <code>Date</code> arguments and assigns the predicate <code>DateIsWithinDateIntervalPredicate</code> which will only show items within the date interval and the Directory path is <strong>User&#8217;s Working Directory</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third constructor takes in 1 <code>Directory Path</code> argument and assigns the predicate as <code>PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_RECORDS</code>, which will show all items in the list and the Directory path is the entered directory path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fourth constructor takes in 1 <code>Directory Path</code> and 2 <code>Date</code> arguments and assigns the predicate as <code>DateIsWithinDateIntervalPredicate</code> which will only show items within the date interval and the Directory path is the entered Directory Path.</p>
</li>
</ul>

Please note that the <code>undo</code> and <code>redo</code> command can only affect the Financial Planner but the not the Excel file created, meaning that when you enter <code>undo</code> command after you enter the <code>archive</code> command, the records archived will be added again back to the Financial Planner but the Excel file created will not be deleted.

<p>This feature will automatically uses the the summary data from the <code>SUMMARY DATA</code> sheet in the Excel sheet after the command <code>archive</code> or <code>export_excel</code> is called.</p>

<p>The feature mechanism is facilitated by <code>ExcelUtil</code>, the utility created to handle all methods relating to Excel. It is the component which manages the interactions between the ExportExcelCommand or the ArchiveCommand with <code>ExcelUtil#drawChart</code>.</p>
