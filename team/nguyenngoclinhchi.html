<h2 id="overview"><a class="link" href="#overview">Overview:</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The NUS CS2113T - Software Engineering and Object Oriented Programming module provided a valuable hands-on experience in developing desktop applications. In groups of 4 - 5 students, guidelines were given out periodically over 10 weeks to shape a user-group-focused application. The objective of the project was to modify a pre-existing general source code <a href="https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/addressbook-level4/">AddressBook Level 4</a>  into a useful program. Desktop application <code>Savee</code> aims to help its users manage their financial status with the motto <strong>Savvy the money</strong>. It is currently designed for <strong>students</strong>. The User and Developer Guides were also written to emulate some of the actual work schedules involved in the public release of an official product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This application enables users to organize data with the command line interface (CLI). <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>date</strong>, <strong>money flow</strong>, and optional <strong>tag</strong> can be recorded. Each record must consists of <strong>name</strong>, <strong>date</strong>, <strong>money flow</strong>. The date component refers to the actual date when the financial activity was performed and the money flow component refers to the income or expenditure. Users will have the opportunity to consider their expenses and possibly become more aware of their financial status. Users will also be able to insert a command into the system using the text box located at the topmost of the Savee application. A Graphic User Interface (GUI), created by JavaFX, will be used to display output of the system so as to create an instinctive and engaging user experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you read User guide and Developer guide, you might be confused as our application has 2 names, Financial Planner and Savee. Both names refers to the app. Savee is the official name of the app when it is marketed for the users. FinancialPlanner is the name used when referring to the app in the developer guide and code.</p>

<h3 id="enhancement-related-contributions"><a class="link" href="#enhancement-related-contributions">Enhancement-related contributions:</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Major enhancements</em></strong> : Morphed the AddressBook4 to Savee.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for enhancement</code>: To enable Savee to keep track of the daily financial activities of the user..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Highlights</code>: A long time was required to read through all 10 kLoc to understand and modify the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code>: I re-factored functions together with variables across classes to make the components compatible and consistent for the application. I also re-structured the code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Major enhancements</em></strong> : Added the feature that allows the user delete all the record whose date is same as date entered.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for enhancement</code>:The application is designed for daily expense/income management. In case the user types in a wrong date at the beginning. This feature allows user to delete multiple records at the same time, compared to the original delete one record at the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Highlights</code>: This major enhancement was simple to code but unexpectedly difficult to debug as it requires a in-depth knowledge for the Internal List structure building up the list of records, and pointer when looping through the list and deleting records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code>: I wrote the code for the command, parser, and tests, and modify other classes and codes to adjust when a new command is added.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Major enhancements</em></strong> : Added the feature that allows the user archive the record data from Savee to the Excel file.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for enhancement</code>: The feature lessens the memory burden of the computer by enabling users to store large amounts of data out of the computer. Users will also be able to share record data with their friends and family members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Highlights</code>: This major enhancement requires significant effort and time, as initially, the library is not included in Java 10 library, I have to read the documentation as well as learn how to utilize the library in the short time. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider this feature as <strong>advanced</strong> feature. Effort was also spent on designing a user-friendly Excel file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code>: This feature can take in <strong>6 different input modes</strong>. This complexity also opens many different routes of errors and much time was spent on testing and debugging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Credits</code>: Apache Poi Library and its inner class were used and modified to fit into the feature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Major enhancements</em></strong> : Added the feature that allows the user import the record data from the Excel file to the Savee.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for enhancement</code>: To enable users to import data back into Savee. There will be unlimited number of sheets that can be imported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Highlights</code>: Similar to the archive feature, a significant effort and time was spent to read and utilize the required documentation. The existence of the directory path of the Excel file was also examined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code>: This feature takes in <strong>2 different input modes</strong>. I have set up the pre-conditions for the Excel file to be successfully imported [refer to the <strong>User guide</strong>].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Credits</code>: Apache Poi Library and its inner class were used and modified to fit into the feature.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>Minor enhancement</em></strong> : Added the feature that automatically draw a line chart in the Excel file.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for enhancement</code>: A line chart into Excel file will be drawn next to the summary data after executing the <code>exportexcel</code> or <code>archive</code> command. This line chart will offer the user a visual display of income, outcome and net financial status based on date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Highlights</code>: : This major enhancement requires significant effort and time, as initially, the library is not included in Java 10 library, I have to read the documentation as well as learn how to utilize the library in the short time. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider this feature as <strong>advanced</strong> feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code>: This feature does not take in any input, as it will be automatically drawn after the Excel file is created, meaning that user enter the <code>exportexcel</code> command or <code>archive</code> command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Credits</code>: Apache Poi Library and its inner class were used and modified to fit into the feature.</p>

<p>If the command is in <strong>Dual argument Date mode</strong>, START_DATE (the first <code>Date</code>) should be earlier than or equal to the END_DATE (the second <code>Date</code>).<br>
Date follow the same configurations as date parameters required when adding records. It is in the form of <strong>dd-mm-yyyy</strong> where <strong>dd</strong> represents day, <strong>mm</strong> represents month and <strong>yyyy</strong> represents the year. <strong>dd</strong> and <strong>mm</strong> both require 1 to 2 digits while
<strong>yyyy</strong> requires exactly 4 digits.</p>

<p>The delete by date entry mechanism is facilitated by <code>ModelManager</code>.
It represents an in-memory model of Savee and is the component which manages the interactions between the commands and the <code>VersionedFinancialPlanner</code>. DeleteByDateEntryCommand calls <code>ModelManager#getFilteredRecordList</code> to retrieve the list of all current records in the Savee. Then, it will loop through the list of records and call <code>ModelManger#deleteRecord(Record record)</code> to delete the record whose date is required. If there exists target records, <code>ModelManager#commitFinancialPlanner</code> will be called to update the current version of Savee and the message, which states records have been deleted. Then, <code>ModelManager#autoLimitCheck</code> will be called to check the current change in limit as we delete some records exceeds the limit or <strong>not</strong>. This feature has only one keyword <code>deletedate</code> and implements only 1 argument mode.
The three argument modes are as listed below:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Single Argument mode&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Requires only one date. It deletes all records whose date is required.

It represents an in-memory model of the Savee and is the component which manages the interactions between the commands, <code>ExcelUtil</code> and the <code>VersionedFinancialPlanner</code>. ExportExcelCommand calls <code>ModelManager#updateFilteredRecords</code> and passes in different predicates depending on the argument mode. The List&lt;Record&gt; is retrieved by calling <code>ModelManager#getFilteredRecordList</code>. Meanwhile, it also called <code>ModelManager#getFinancialPlanner</code> to get the <code>ReadOnlyFinancialPlanner</code>. The SummaryByDateList is constructed after the ReadOnlyFinancialPlanner together with the predicate are passed into the construction of SummaryByDateList. The List&lt;SummaryEntry&gt; is easily retrieved from SummaryByDateList by calling <code>SummaryByDateList#getSummaryList</code>. <code>ExcelUtil#setNameExcelFile</code> is called to make the Excel name based on the condition of startDate and endDate. After that, <code>ExcelUtil#setPathFile</code> is called to set the Path file, which is the location of the Excel file stored in future. The Path file is constructed based on the name of the Excel file we retrieve above and the directory Path, it can be either optionally entered by the user or the default <strong>User&#8217;s Working Directory</strong>. With the sufficient information, <code>List&lt;Record&gt; records</code>, <code>List&lt;SummaryByDateEntry&gt; summaryList</code>, <code>file path</code>, <code>ExportExcelCommand#exportDataIntoExcelSheetWithGivenRecords</code> is called to start the processing of producing Excel file.</p>

If blank row is found, the <code>ExcelUtil#readExcelSheet</code> will ignore and read the next line, until the last line is read. This concept also applies to read multiple sheets until all sheets have been read. However, please take note that in order to prevent errors, there are certain constraints of Excel file list in <strong>User Guide</strong> with <strong>Import the record data from the Excel file to the Savee</strong> part.
