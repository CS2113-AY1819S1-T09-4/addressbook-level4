<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FinancialPlanner is an application my team has created for the NUS module CS2113T. In this module, we were taught basic software
engineering principles and object oriented programming. This project lasted for 10 weeks and we were tasked to develop a desktop application
for a particular group of users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FinancialPlanner&#8217;s main target audience are students who need help managing their finances.
They like typing and are often much more proficient in organising their data with command line interface (CLI). In FinancialPlanner,
there is a text box located at the topmost part of the application which users can use to type commands into the system. Graphic user interface(GUI)
created using JavaFX was also used to display the output of the system to create a more intuitive and engaging user experience.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="summary-of-contributions"><a class="link" href="#summary-of-contributions">Summary of contributions</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FinancialPlanner was adapted from <a href="https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/addressbook-level4/">AddressBook Level 4</a>, a sample codebase given by the module.
There were milestones to meet every fortnight and each milestone required a working product. Throughout this development cycle, I have made much contributions to the team and below shows a summary of my
contributions.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="application-code-related-contributions"><a class="link" href="#application-code-related-contributions">Application Code related contributions</a></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major Enhancements</strong>: Facilitated the morph from AddressBook Level 4 to FinancialPlanner</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for the enhancement</code> FinancialPlanner is mainly targeted at users who wants to store and keep track of their daily financial activity. This is significantly
different from the original AddressBook Level 4, thus significant effort was needed to morph into FinancialPlanner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code> I adapted all functions that involved addition, removal and editing of the app data into functions able to process data required. I also fixed
all the tests that broke as a result of the morph.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major Enhancements</strong>: Added a feature that allows users to display a summary of their expenses and income by day, month and categories in a table</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for the enhancement</code> Users want to have a way to track daily or monthly financial activities without having to go through the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Brief Description</code> To see the summary within any date range, the user needs to enter 2 dates or 2 months and the corresponding parameters and the system would
generate a summary table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code> I created the framework for this feature. It covers many components comprising of parsing, data manipulation, logic and graphic user interface as output. The
report was generated on a table panel which can be switched around with other user interface panels as necessary. I created all java logic components and the Java fxml layout files for the
user interface to display correctly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major Enhancements</strong>: Added a feature that shows the breakdown of financial activity into categories</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for the enhancement</code> FinancialPlanner also allows users to tag each financial activity with a category that they can define. Sometimes, users
would like to know where they are spending their money on in order to make informed decisions on their future finance activities. Since each record is tagged with
an optional set of tags, these tags can be used as categories for users to classify each financial activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Overview</code> To further empower users to make informed choices, the statistics feature was designed to provide a detailed breakdown of all financial
activity within a given period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code> For this feature, there were 3 main parts, the parsing and command logic, the model that supports the data manipulation and the user interface that
allows the users to view the output. I created all the components necessary for this feature, with the most noteworthy implementation being user interface. Similar to summary,
the Ui panel in this feature can be switched out for other panels. Furthermore, I created tabs to allow users to switch between expense and income for greater usability. The pie charts used
were generated using JavaFX pie chart library. However, I overwrote some parts of the in to allow for greater functionality using Java&#8217;s overriding feature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major Enhancements</strong>: Added a feature that allows swapping of UI panels.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for the enhancement</code> For increased user friendliness, FinancialPlanner supports commands which draws charts using the in built UI. This meant that sufficient space
needed to be given to these UI panels for the chart to look right and the data points to be seen clearly. Thus, the usual approach of splitting the application in the panel is not effective.
To overcome this challenge, swapping UI algorithms were designed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Overview</code> The swapping UI algorithm manages UI panels and decides which panels will be shown while keeping the rest hidden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code> The main connections between UI components and the rest of FinancialPlanner is through Google&#8217;s event system. I created new classes and utilised interfaces to allow for
the switching functionality in the main UI panels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major Enhancements</strong>: Added a welcome panel that displays breakdown for current month</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for the enhancement</code>  Users may want to get a sense of their current financial status without having
to type a single command. By having the panel updated, users can instantly get feedback on their current financial status whenever they add a new
record to the system. This improved the user friendliness of our app significantly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Overview</code> This feature serves as the front page of the application. It displays the category breakdown of current month and is automatically
updated whenever the data in the application is changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code> Since this feature is automatic and should not require any user input, I created new methods that can track the current date and cached all records associated with
the current month in the <strong>ModelManager</strong> on start up. I also hooked up this cached list to main model to listen to any changes to the underlying list and update itself as necessary. Furthermore,
I created the welcome panel UI layout and logic to read from this list whenever it updates and refresh the UI panel.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor Enhancements</strong>: Added an extension to list command</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for the enhancement</code> Originally, the list command would list all records in the application. This may not be very convenient when the
number of records become very large. Thus, a more specific and user friendly command is introduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Overview</code> This list command allows users to specify the date range and will only show records in that range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code> ListCommandParser of the original implementation was tweaked slightly to allow additional functionality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor Enhancements</strong>: Helped to make storage more modular and combined storage for fellow teammates</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for enhancement</code> The storage of AddressBook Level 4 was mainly targetted at storing only one thing and it was hard to extend the feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code> Thus, I created new interfaces which utilises Java&#8217;s generic type to allow for greater flexibility when calling the function that saves to XML.
This broke many of the tests, and to preserve the coverage at a high level of 80%, I fixed all the tests relating to storage and combined storage for limitlist and recordlist together which is
also used by other teammates.</p>

Due to label constraints, some labels may not be displaying correctly if they are overlapping with other labels. This happens when the pie slice
is too small. To improve readability, we have decided to hide some labels in such scenarios. Also, when the label is too long, since the pie charts
need to fit the labels, the pie chart may become small as a result. To prevent such situations, please keep your labels short. This will be improved in
later versions of the product to remove the labels completely and use a mouse over input instead.

<p>Dual Argument mode&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Requires 2 dates, a <code>start date</code> and an <code>end date</code>. It returns all records containing dates within the time frame of start date and end date, inclusive of both start date and end date
The mechanism that facilitates these modes can be found in the <code>ListCommandParser#parse</code>. Below is a overview of the mechanism:</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The input given by the user is passed to <code>ArgumentTokeniser#tokenise</code> to split the input separated by prefixes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This returns a <code>ArgumentMultiMap</code> which contains a map with prefixes as keys and their associated input arguments as the value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The string associated with <code>d/</code> is then passed into <code>ListCommandParser#splitByWhitespace</code> for further processing and returns an array.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The argument mode is determined by the size of this array and the elements are further processed into <code>Date</code> objects, before creating and returning a <code>ListCommand</code> object.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>ListCommand</code> has two constructors which makes use of overloading to reduce code complexity.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>One constructor has no arguments and assigns default predicate for the <code>FilteredList</code> in <code>ModelManager</code>,
<code>PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_RECORDS</code> which will show all items in the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second constructor takes in 2 <code>Date</code> arguments and assigns the predicate <code>DateIsWithinDateIntervalPredicate</code> which will only show items within the date interval.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>For simplicity, interactions with the UI is not shown in the diagram above.<br>
The update of the UI <code>RecordListPanel</code> is done through the event system. <code>FilteredList</code> is a type of ObservableList
implemented by the Java 8 API and it will propagate any changes to the list to any listeners listening to it. This
listener is present in <code>RecordListPanel</code> and will update the UI list automatically.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Uses a FilteredList that is tracked by the UI.

<div class="ulist">

<p>Pros: Easy to implement</p>

<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Implement a HashMap with Date as the key and Record as the value.</p>

<p>Pros: Allows for constant time complexity to access any elements. Hence, listing records can potentially be faster.</p>
</li>

<p>Cons: Current UI implementation relies on <code>FilteredList</code>. In order for UI to be compatible with the new data structure, the UI may need to change its implementation to <code>ObservableMap</code> instead. Alternatively, one can utilise a <code>HashMap</code> to first generate the list and pass the list reference into <code>FilteredList</code>. However, there is a need to code a filter function.</p>

<p>This feature allows the user to view a summary table of all their financial activity within a period of time. There are 3 different ways the user can
view the summary, one is summary by date which means the summary of each day in the period will be provided, summary by month or summary by category.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The corresponding command required for this feature is <code>summary</code> and the user will have to supply 2 dates and a compulsory parameter <code>mode</code> which determines whether
they are viewing <strong>summary by date, by month or by category</strong>. This feature involves most components of FinancialPlanner with the exception of <code>Storage</code>. It can also be broadly split into
2 phases, the logic phase which generates the summary and the UI phase which allows users to view the summary in a table.</p>

<li>
<p>When the user types in the command "summary date d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018", the command is passed from LogicManager to FinancialPlannerParser. In here,
the system chooses which parser to use which is SummaryCommandParser and calls its parse method which is polymorphic, meaning that every parser has the same function but use different
implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this class, based on the <code>mode</code> parameter given, the system chooses a SummaryCommand to instantiate and pass the reference back to the Logic Manager. The various checks for the validity of the
parameters also occur during this stage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the SummaryCommandObject is created, <code>SummaryByDateCommand#execute</code> is called. The responsibility of SummaryByDateCommand is a manager that has retrieves information from model and passes it to other components.
SummaryByDateCommand gets the filtered list from Model using <code>Model#getFilteredRecordList</code> and passes it to the constructor of SummaryByDateList. The creates <code>SummaryList</code> object which is then
passed into a <code>ShowSummaryTableEvent</code> before trigger.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Generate the summary list whenever the summary command is called.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Easier to implement and maintain. Sufficient for the intended target audience of FinancialPlanner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: This requires looping through each record in the filtered record list obtained from the <code>Model</code>.
To aid in the time complexity, the internal implementation of SummaryList was done using hash maps instead with allowed for
constant time random access unlike list. However, the initial filtering is close to linear time complexity which could slow down the app if many records are inside.
Also, the list had to be created every time <code>summary</code> is called which could be slow if the command is called multiple times.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Morph the record list into a record hash map of record lists instead</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: A hash map allows for constant random access to a record list of a particular date assuming the key for the hash map is using dates.
Thus, the filtering function does not need to loop through as many records and the time taken would be lower especially when the database in the application is large.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Might be too specific to only 1 type of category like categorising by date. If any other types are required, another map may have to be added. This implementation may make the
system rigid and hard to modify in the future. Also, the summary list still had to be generated every time command is called.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 3:</strong> Cache the summary list in financial planner</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: By caching the summary list in the financial planner and assigning a boolean variable along with information on the filter predicate to it to determine if it is modified, we can
reduce the number of times summary list is recreated every time the <code>summary</code> command is called. When the <code>summary</code> command is called, it checks the
boolean variable to see if summary list needs to be modified. If it doesn&#8217;t need to be regenerated, the system will simply read directly from <code>ModelManager</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: This implementation involves tracking of the state of the summary list. If it is not done systematically, it may have some hidden bugs which can be hard to test.
Also, if the sequence of commands is as follows, <strong>summary, add, summary</strong>, the time required is still long.</p>

<p>Pros: Easy to implement and apply it to other newly created panels. To make use of the current implementation, the panel can simply be the children of

<li>
<p>Cons: Might be inefficient when there are many panels or many switching as the same process must be repeated for all panels.

This feature is facilitated by a few key components of FinancialPlanner, <code>Logic</code>, <code>Model</code>, <code>UI</code> and function executions can be split into 2 phases, the <code>Logic phase</code> and the <code>UI phase</code>.
The detailed execution sequence of functions used for <code>Logic phase</code> are as shown below.</p>

<p>When user enters the command, the <code>LogicManager</code> recognises the command and calls the <code>FinancialPlannerParser</code> to process the new command as shown above.</p>

<li>
<p>The FinancialPlannerParser will then search for the <code>stats</code> keyword required and once it is found, the rest of the command minus the keyword is passed in as a
parameter to StatisticCommandParser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The StatisticCommandParser will then parse the arguments and create a new StatisticCommand object before returning its reference. The activity diagram below details the mechanism

<li>
<p>Once <code>StatisticCommand#execute</code> is called, it will then search through the in-memory data of FinancialPlanner and return a list containing all records within the date range and including
both the start dates and end dates. This functionality is facilitated by the <code>ModelManager</code> which is the class that manages all interactions between
<code>Logic</code> and <code>Model</code> component, by`ModelManager#updateFilteredRecords`. The command then retrieves the filteredList from ModelManager and passes it into
the constructor of <code>CategoryStatisticsList</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this constructor, it will loop through all the records in the list and add them into an internal map. The internal data structure in <code>CategoryStatisticsList</code> is a hash map,
to aid in the adding process, however it only outputs lists and not the map. This functionality is facilitated by <code>CategoryStatisticsList#addToCategoryStatistics</code> which checks whether the record
is in the map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the record is not present, it creates a new <code>CategoryStatistic</code> object and adds that to the map. If the record is present, the record is then added to the existing <code>CategoryStatistic</code> object.</p>

<p>The flow of control returns to StatisticCommand and StatisticCommand calls the read function of CategoryStatisticsList to obtain a read-only list and passes it into
an event constructor before posting the event <code>ShowPieChartStatsEvent</code>.</p>

<p>After the event is posted, the execution proceeds to the <code>UI phase</code> where there is a listener in <code>MainWindow</code> listening to this event. This is facilitated by

<ul>
<li>
<p>When the event is caught by the listener in <code>MainWindow</code>, <code>MainWindow</code> looks through all children of the <code>MainWindow#mainUiPanelPlaceholder</code> and executes the hide function in them.
This will make all children hidden from view in the UI which ensures that the UI is displayed correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As shown above, the function <code>StatsDisplayPanel#handleShowPieChartDataEvent</code> is called which will call the constructor of <code>MixedPieChartData</code>. The detailed execution details within this class is as shown in
