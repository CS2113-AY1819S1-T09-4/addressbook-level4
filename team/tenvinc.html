<div class="paragraph">
<p>Savee is an application my team has created for the NUS module CS2113T on Software Engineering Principles and Object Oriented Programming.
Savee&#8217;s main target audience are students who need help managing their finances and likes typing. In Savee,
there is a command box for inputting commands and graphic user interface(GUI)
created using JavaFX was also used to display the output of the system to create a more intuitive and engaging user experience.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major Enhancements</strong>: Facilitated the morph from AddressBook Level 4 to Savee</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for the enhancement</code> Savee is mainly targeted at users who wants to store and keep track of their daily financial activity, which is not the same as AB4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code> I adapted all model and storage components. I also fixed all the tests that broke as a result of the morph.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major Enhancements</strong>: Added a feature that allows users to display a summary of their expenses and income by day, month and categories in a table</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for the enhancement</code> Users want to have a way to track daily or monthly financial activities without having to go through the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Brief Description</code> To see the summary within any date range, the user needs to enter 2 dates or 2 months and the corresponding parameters and the system would
generate a summary table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code> I created the framework for this feature. It covers many components comprising of parsing, data manipulation, logic and graphic user interface as output. The
report was generated on a table panel which can be switched around with other user interface panels as necessary. I created all java logic components and the Java fxml layout files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major Enhancements</strong>: Added a feature that shows the breakdown of financial activity into categories</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for the enhancement</code> Savee also allows users to tag each financial activity with a tag that they can define. These tags can be used for analysing financial activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Overview</code> To further empower users to make informed choices, the statistics feature was designed to provide a detailed breakdown of all financial
activity within a given period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code> For this feature, there were 3 main parts, logic for the command, model to support statistics and the GUI. I created all the components necessary for this feature, with the most noteworthy implementation being user interface. Similar to summary,
the Ui panel in this feature can be switched out for other panels. The pie charts used were generated using JavaFX pie chart library. However, I overwrote some parts of the in to allow for greater functionality using Java&#8217;s overriding feature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor Enhancements</strong>: Added a welcome panel that displays breakdown for current month</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Reason for the enhancement</code>  Users may want to get a sense of their current financial status without having
to type a single command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>My contributions</code> I created a system to track the current date and refresh the UI panel whenever it detects changes to the underlying list.</p>

Due to label constraints, some labels may not be displaying correctly if they are overlapping with other labels. This happens when the pie slice
is too small. To improve readability, we have decided to hide some labels in such scenarios. Also, when the label is too long, since the pie charts
need to fit the labels, the pie chart may become small as a result. To prevent such situations, please keep your labels short. This will be improved in
later versions of the product to remove the labels completely and use a mouse over input instead.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature allows the user to view a summary table of all their financial activity within a period of time. There are 3 different ways the user can
view the summary, one is summary by date which means the summary of each day in the period will be provided, summary by month or summary by category.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The corresponding command required for this feature is <code>summary</code> and the user will have to supply 2 dates and a compulsory parameter <code>mode</code> which determines whether
they are viewing <strong>summary by date, by month or by category</strong>. This feature involves most components of FinancialPlanner with the exception of <code>Storage</code>. It can also be broadly split into
2 phases, the logic phase which generates the summary and the UI phase which allows users to view the summary in a table.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As shown below, <code>SummaryByDateCommand</code>, <code>SummaryByCategoryCommand</code>, <code>SummaryByMonthCommand</code> is a type of SummaryCommand and thus inherits from <code>SummaryCommand</code>. The rationale behind this design choice is that
code shared by these classes can be placed in <code>SummaryCommand</code> for code reuse. This makes it easier for future developers to easily extend this functionality.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 1. Class diagram showing the inheritance from SummaryCommand</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, these commands utilise their own version of summary lists which is also inherited from the parent class <code>SummaryList</code> as shown below. Below details the logic phase.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>When the user types in the command "summary date d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018", the command is passed from LogicManager to FinancialPlannerParser. In here,
the system chooses which parser to use and calls its parse method which is polymorphic, meaning that every parser has the same function but use different
implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this class, based on the <code>mode</code> parameter given, the system chooses a SummaryCommand to instantiate and pass the reference back to the Logic Manager. The various checks for the validity of the
parameters also occur during this stage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the SummaryCommandObject is created, <code>SummaryByDateCommand#execute</code> is called. The responsibility of SummaryByDateCommand is a manager that has retrieves information from model and passes it to other components.
SummaryByDateCommand gets the filtered list from Model using <code>Model#getFilteredRecordList</code> and passes it to the constructor of SummaryByDateList. The creates <code>SummaryList</code> object which is then
passed into a <code>ShowSummaryTableEvent</code> before triggering the event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The entire logic process is the same for SummaryByMonthCommand and SummaryByCategoryCommand but uses different lists.</p>

<li>
<p><code>MainWindow</code> will listen for the <code>ShowSummaryTableEvent</code> and render all Main UI panels invisible before rendering <code>StatsDisplayPanel</code> visible.</p>

<h5 id="aspect-method-of-generating-the-summary"><a class="link" href="#aspect-method-of-generating-the-summary">Aspect: Method of generating the summary</a></h5>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Generate the summary list whenever the summary command is called.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Easier to implement and maintain. Sufficient for the intended target audience of FinancialPlanner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: This requires looping through each record in the filtered record list obtained from the <code>Model</code>.
To aid in the time complexity, the internal implementation of SummaryList was done using hash maps instead which allowed for
constant time random access.. However, the initial filtering is close to linear time complexity which could slow down the app if many records are inside.
Also, the list had to be created every time <code>summary</code> is called which could be slow if the command is called multiple times.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Morph the record list into a record hash map of record lists instead</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: A hash map allows for constant random access to a record list of a particular date assuming the key for the hash map is using dates.
Thus, the filtering function does not need to loop through as many records and the time taken would be lower especially when the database in the application is large.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Might be too specific to only 1 type of category like categorising by date. If any other types are required, another map may have to be added. This implementation may make the
system rigid and hard to modify in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 3:</strong> Cache the summary list in financial planner</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: By caching the summary list in the financial planner and assigning a boolean variable along with information on the filter predicate to it to determine if it is modified, we can
reduce the number of times summary list is recreated every time the <code>summary</code> command is called. When the <code>summary</code> command is called, it checks the
boolean variable to see if summary list needs to be modified. If it doesn&#8217;t need to be regenerated, the system will simply read directly from <code>ModelManager</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: This implementation involves tracking of the state of the summary list. If it is not done systematically, it may have some hidden bugs which can be hard to test.
Also, if the sequence of commands is as follows, <strong>summary, add, summary</strong>, the time required is still long.</p>

<p>This feature allows the user to view a pie chart breakdown o

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The corresponding command required for this feature is <code>stats</code>.For this feature, users have to enter 2 dates, one starting date and one ending date.
This feature is facilitated by a few key components of FinancialPlanner, <code>Logic</code>, <code>Model</code>, <code>UI</code> and function executions can be split into 2 phases, the <code>Logic phase</code> and the <code>UI phase</code>.
The detailed execution sequence of functions used for <code>Logic phase</code> are as shown below.</p>

<p>Consider the situation where the user enters <strong>"stats d/1-1-2018 12-12-2018"</strong>:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When user enters the command, the <code>LogicManager</code> recognises the command and calls the <code>FinancialPlannerParser</code> to process the new command as shown above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The FinancialPlannerParser will then search for the <code>stats</code> keyword required and once it is found, the rest of the command minus the keyword is passed in as a
parameter to StatisticCommandParser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The StatisticCommandParser will then parse the arguments and create a new StatisticCommand object before returning its reference. The activity diagram below details the mechanism
within the <code>StatisticCommandParser#parse</code> method.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Once <code>StatisticCommand#execute</code> is called, it will then search through the in-memory data of FinancialPlanner and return a list containing all records within the date range and including
both the start dates and end dates. This functionality is facilitated by the <code>ModelManager</code> which is the class that manages all interactions between
<code>Logic</code> and <code>Model</code> component, by`ModelManager#updateFilteredRecords`. The command then retrieves the filteredList from ModelManager and passes it into
the constructor of <code>CategoryStatisticsList</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this constructor, it will loop through all the records in the list and add them into an internal map. The internal data structure in <code>CategoryStatisticsList</code> is a hash map,
to aid in the adding process, however it only outputs lists and not the map. This functionality is facilitated by <code>CategoryStatisticsList#addToCategoryStatistics</code> which checks whether the record
is in the map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the record is not present, it creates a new <code>CategoryStatistic</code> object and adds that to the map. If the record is present, the record is then added to the existing <code>CategoryStatistic</code> object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The flow of control returns to StatisticCommand and StatisticCommand calls the read function of CategoryStatisticsList to obtain a read-only list and passes it into
an event constructor before posting the event <code>ShowPieChartStatsEvent</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the event is posted, the execution proceeds to the <code>UI phase</code> where there is a listener in <code>MainWindow</code> listening to this event. This is facilitated by
the event system in FinancialPlanner. The sequence diagram below details the program flow of the functions executed in <code>UI phase</code> for creating the pie chart for total expense.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>When the event is caught by the listener in <code>MainWindow</code>, <code>MainWindow</code> looks through all children of the <code>MainWindow#mainUiPanelPlaceholder</code> and executes the hide function in them.
This will make all children hidden from view in the UI which ensures that the UI is displayed correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As shown above, the function <code>StatsDisplayPanel#handleShowPieChartDataEvent</code> is called which will call the constructor of <code>MixedPieChartData</code>. The detailed execution details within this class is as shown in

<p>The program flow is then as shown above where the <code>CategoryBreakdown</code> is created and instantiated with 2 lists, one being expenseLabelData and other being expenseLegendData.
In the current implementation, whenever <code>stats</code> is called, 2 tabs will be created, one for total income and one for total expense. Thus, the same program sequence after construction for
<code>CategoryBreakdown</code> is also repeated for total income.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> The pie chart breakdown is regenerated from the filtered list every time this command is called.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Reduce overhead during normal operations like adding, deleting and editing if we do not have to update the statistics in real time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: If the command is called multiple times, this process could be repeated many times which may make the app sluggish when there are many records.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Use a data structure to store the statistic information when there is mutation of data</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Since the statistics are constantly updated, whenever the command is called, system can read directly and not have to recompute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Adds overhead to usual operations. Benefits may not be visible if the command is not called frequently.</p>
